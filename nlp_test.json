(Photo: AFP/Charly Triballeau)\n\n&gt; A government official said 11 people had left, but declined to say whether more would depart Friday or offer further details.\n\n&gt; The move comes a day after the number of infections diagnosed on the ship rose to 218.\n\n&gt; Senior health ministry official Gaku Hashimoto boarded the ship Friday morning to announce that all passengers \"who are considered to be high risk in general health\" would now be tested for the virus.\n\n&gt; \"Those who test positive will be transferred to the hospital. Those who test negative will - at the request of the individual - disembark and be transferred to accommodation provided by the government,\" he said in a statement in English read out by the ship's captain in a public broadcast.\n\n&gt; \"We are aware that many people are worried and concerned about the situation. However, to improve the situation as much as possible, the government is making its best efforts,\" the statement said.\n\n&gt; There were more than 3,700 people on the ship when it arrived off the Japanese coast last week, but those diagnosed with the disease have been taken off the boat, along with some people suffering other health conditions requiring medical attention.\n\n&gt; Ten of those hospitalised are now in serious condition, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Friday.\n\n&gt; Excluding the cases on the ship, and an infected quarantine officer, Japanese authorities have so far diagnosed 33 people with the newly named COVID-19.\n\n&gt; The newly diagnosed cases include a woman in her 80s whose positive test result emerged after she died in hospital.\n\n&gt; The woman was reportedly the mother-in-law of a taxi driver in Tokyo who has also been diagnosed with the virus.\n\n&gt; DOCTOR, PATIENT INFECTED\n\n&gt; A doctor in Wakayama prefecture and a patient treated in the hospital where the doctor worked have also been diagnosed.\n\n&gt; Officials in the region said they were still not sure if the doctor had infected the patient.\n\n&gt; \"It is difficult to trace the route of the infection\", governor Yoshinobu Nisaka told reporters.\n\n&gt; He said officials were asking people in the area \"to report suspicious cases of pneumonia so that we can immediately conduct tests\".\n\n&gt; Passengers on the Diamond Princess are confined to their cabins except for brief outings on open decks wearing facemasks. (Photo: AFP/Charly Triballeau)\n\n&gt; The hospital has been closed to visitors and medical staff are now being tested for the virus, Nisaka added.\n\n&gt; Despite the new infections, government officials sought to play down concerns about the spread of the virus in Japan.\n\n&gt; \"There is not enough epidemiological evidence to suggest that the epidemic is spreading inside Japan,\" government spokesman Yoshihide Suga told reporters.\n\n&gt; \"We will keep collecting epidemiological information including on the routes of infection.\"\n\n&gt; The Diamond Princess has been quarantined off Japan since early February after it emerged a former passenger who got off the boat in Hong Kong had tested positive for the virus.\n\n&gt; The Diamond Princess is expected to stay in quarantine until Feb 19, 2019. (Photo: AFP/Charly Triballeau)\n\n&gt; The quarantine is due to end on Feb 19 and those on the ship have been mostly confined to their cabins and asked to wear masks and keep their distance from other passengers during brief outings on open deck.\n\n&gt; Crew on board have expressed concern that their conditions-- including shared cabins, bathrooms and workspaces - put them at greater risk of contracting the virus.\n\n&gt; On Friday afternoon, the crew distributed iPhones to passengers on board, with the captain saying the handsets had been sent by the Japanese government.\n\n&gt; \"We are distributing iPhones to all staterooms, loaded with an application ... (that) will help you to get medical support.

I'm not trying to be an alarmist here, I'm trying to be a realist. I would be EXTREMELY surprised if this doesn't kill at least a couple million people in the US.\n\nExperts are saying that up to 70% could be infected - even in countries where they are doing a relatively good job of trying to contain the virus, and doing better testing. The US is not. The government is actively downplaying the virus, telling people to still go to work even if they have it, refusing to institute sick pay/sick days for people who have it, not providing testing and actively preventing it in many cases.\n\nSo let's do some math:\n\n* US population is roughly 330 million.\n* Up to 70% of people could be infected, but let's REALLY lowball it and say that only 30% of Americans will get the coronavirus, and also assume that nobody who recovers is re-infected. **So for a low estimate let's say 100 million Americans catch the coronavirus.**\n* Worldwide mortality rate is about 3.4%. Right now there are 1,281 confirmed cases, 36 deaths, and 15 recoveries in the US. That means that right now, there is a 2.8% death rate in the US - but almost all of those cases are very new, and that 2.8% is assuming that NOBODY who currently has the virus dies from it. If we look at \"resolved cases\", the death rate is like 67% so far (but obviously that will drop a lot). **So let's just assume the death rate of 3.4% worldwide will hold true for the US as well.**\n* It will come as a shock to nobody if I saw that the US healthcare system is extremely problematic. Even if you have the utmost faith in US doctors, the reality is that MANY people don't have access to healthcare, and access is far lower than in most other countries. There is also the inevitability that hospitals will be completely overwhelmed and unable to handle the number of incoming cases, which will be true for many countries, not just the US, and will lead to more deaths because people are unable to get care. **But let's be generous and assume that access to healthcare will remain as good as it is now when there are millions of people infected**, so we won't add more deaths to account for that.\n\n----\n\nSo: here is a relatively GOOD scenario. 30% of Americans get the virus. 330 million Americans, 100 million Americans infected, 3.4% of those people die. That's 3,400,000 Americans dead.\n\nHere's a worse-case scenario: 70% of Americans get infected (231 million). Hospitals are completely overwhelmed. A small portion of people need emergency treatment and can't get it, they need to be intubated and it's logistically impossible, and they die. Death rate rises to 5%. That's 11,550,000 Americans dead.\n\nTo be a bit of a doomsayer: I think that the death rate in MOST countries will probably be higher than it looks now, and that the death rate in the US will be worse as it is now.\n\n&gt; Nobody is doubting that it works, just that human rights are more important than a disease, even if that means people will die.\n\nWhen we are talking about literally millions of people, I disagree with you. This isn't Patriot Act bullshit, which was based on nothing but fearmongering.

But also related to nose, which is mouth the virus can travel via infected droplets or mistified virus because a virus particle could be  [0.1 microns](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284691618_SARS_Coronavirus_UV_Susceptibility)  and could pass through even n95 masks if ur unlucky, its also worth noting that the food you ingest that are contaminated or having virus on your hands after touching an infected object and rubbing your eyes or touching our mouth will give you the virus as the virus has an attack success rate of 85% meaning don't fucking touch your eyes or mouth before washing ur hands.\n\nlastly the grossest part, it is similar to SARS were one of the symptoms were diarrhea and the virus could get mistified through the flushing process and infect the whole bathroom walls and the next immediate occupant  Lol.(side note again, pregnant mothers who are infected can transmit the virus via birth\\*currently unproven whether it was just cross contamination though\\*) also some fun fact provided by Germany, a recovered patient can be reinfected again with the virus.\n\nas to the severity of the symptoms like you've asked , it ranges from severe pneumonia where the whole lung is scarred white to just flu like symptoms, it can infect any  age range from newborn infant to 80 year old grand mamas and papas. no one is more or less susceptible to death from the virus as healthy individuals could suddenly come down with pneumonia  without prior respiratory symptoms or cardiac issues and most of the deaths are from cardiac arrest. nor does it really have a preference on what it likes to kill, only two data we have currently of healthy individual's dying was the only hong kong death where the patient who was 39 ([Hkfreepress](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2020/02/04/__trashed-21/)) and was traveling to wuhan in 21st without a mask to visit his relatives and returned in the 23rd before the wuhan city wide quarantine, he was one of the 5 millions who escaped wuhan lockdown, he entered back to hongkong in the 23rd and few days later showed symptoms and later responded positive to the n-cov test and was admitted to the hospital via a taxi, then it was found that he had infected his elderly mother who was 84 as well. in feb 2nd his condition worsened and he succumbed to the wuhan pneumonia at the age of 39.\n\nthe second case should be famous by now [of a doctor Li](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iikPfpXl0) who had first discovered sars like symptoms in 7 of his patients and then tried to warn his colleagues on government monitored social media, the state of wuhan wasn't pleased and forced him to sign a letter of admission that he was spreading lies and fear mongering as well as endangering the welfare of his country which carried a 5 year sentence or else [face consequences (here's the translated document by the bbc)](https://imgur.com/a/5coTtXe). he died approximately Wednesday 5th of January 2020 due to cardiac arrest but in an attempt to cover up he was still on oxygen tube despite having no vitals for two days as the state attempted to cover up his death unsuccessfully because two days later he was reported to have died and he had no signs of previous illness as well as being a fit man in his mid thirties.\n\nbut outside of these two cases i do not have any hard data on death toll but inside wuhan because the state has stopped being updating the death figures inside wuhan as n-cov virus outside of its original hospitals. i only know that the people of wuhan have [posted online videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U1VYck6KOo) like seeing 8 yellow body  bags and corpses still still having their oxygen tube stuck in while their son lie next to him in his bed crying that hes cant breath and is dying (side note the cameraman was also arrested for disturbing the peace and spreading rumors to cause mass panic) but due to the viral nature of the video and public outcry the local reporter was released. and also videos of china building [death camps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdGjm_94ho4) that have no doctors or nurses to administer any medicine as well as an order that once you enter you wont be getting out. i can only guesstimate the situation in wuhan as being dire and the virus is more serious than what optimistic Singaporeans believes in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nand a big warning to you all, the incubation period is 90% at 2-14 days more or less with most showing symptoms at 4-7 days and some fringe case were its even longer at a whopping 16 days to show symptoms. these can be called \u96b1\u5f62\u75c5\u4eba or asymptomatic patients those still in the incubation period could show virtually no symptoms like cough and the common pneumonia fever but are actually super transmitters in that period due to not knowing they're infected. i hope it was informative and you've learned most of the things about n-cov and it's transmission :D. good luck y'all and  remember wear a mask :))\n\n##", "subreddit": "singapore", "created_utc": 1581115104, "author": "Willporker", "link_id":

learn in ECON 101, it\u2019s that there is no free lunch; if you\u2019re not paying for a service, someone else is. Medicare for all is no exception. If implemented, it will not be free \u2014 rather it will be financed by real taxpayer money. Medicare for all is estimated to\u00a0cost\u00a0more than $32.6 trillion over 10 years. That means an average of $3.26 trillion annually. In fiscal 2016, Medicare and Medicaid combined to\u00a0cost\u00a0$1.24 trillion, so under a universal health care system, spending would increase to nearly triple the current amount. However, the federal budget for fiscal year 2019 is $4.41 trillion, so in order to pay for this costly program, we\u2019d need to account for a larger budget of $6.43 trillion. But where would we get an additional $2.02 trillion annually?\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 answer to this question seems to be the usual one:\u00a0the rich will pay. The Democrats would not dare to cut spending for other social programs. They likely wouldn\u2019t even consider cutting Social Security spending by raising the retirement age \u2014 which would be a common-sense action as the system will likely go\u00a0bankrupt\u00a0by 2034 due to the mass retirement of baby boomers. The programs Democrats have proposed cuts to, especially\u00a0the military, would simply not yield enough money: U.S. military spending is only\u00a0$700 billion. Compared to the needed $2 trillion, it\u2019s just a grain of sand in the desert. And at what cost? Such cuts would undermine the security of both the United States and its European allies. The geopolitical situation in the world is already tense, and America cannot risk weakening the defenses of NATO in Europe and around the world.\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with the wealthy paying substantially more than the lower and middle class for welfare? The rich are far from being the main recipients of federally subsidized welfare. Raising the taxes for the top bracket to an alarming 52 percent (this is\u00a0proposed\u00a0by Senator Sanders (I-Vt.), who caucuses with the Democrats and is one of the main supporters of single-payer health care in America) would force people who don\u2019t benefit from a service to pay more for this service than those who benefit from it. That hardly sounds fair. Worse, taxing the rich too highly deprives people of the\u00a0incentive\u00a0to get rich while also driving\u00a0rich job-creators\u00a0away from the country. These factors can combine to cause economic stagnation, or worse, a recession \u2014 hurting all Americans in the process.\n\nHowever, if, instead, the U.S. does not raise taxes, the debt accumulation would increase from\u00a0$1 trillion per annum\u00a0to $3 trillion. That would mean that in less than 50 years all tax revenue will be spent on paying the debt\u2019s accumulated interest. America would go bankrupt. These are some of the many issues with Medicare for all: it will put every American on one health care insurance standard, which will be mediocre at best, and current proposals don\u2019t answer the questions of how much it will cover and if wealthier people will be able to buy better insurance.Moreover, it would likely murder the health insurance market, driving providers out of business and leaving many people unemployed. Eliminating market competition will cost the country quality insurance. Medicare for all is a simplistic answer to the challenge of achieving universal health care. While it looks good on paper, Medicare for all could have catastrophic consequences. \n\nSo realistically.. no it doesn't change my mind because of the Corona virus. The media needs to learn to stay out of shit. No virus should be downplayed period, but it also shouldn't be used to create mass hysteria. Think of it like bee stings and allergies.. if you're not allergic to bees, it's still gonna hurt being stung but you're less likely to die from it. Where as if you're allergic to bees, you're more like to die or have serious symptoms. I'm more concerned about the people who actually become sick and don't have access to supplies because everyone else is buying it up leaving nothing for the others. Media hype. Why do you need Costco size value packs of toilet paper for a virus that doesn't effect the bowels? Media hype. None of this makes sense to me anyways.. the time frame just seems a bit strange to me. \n\nSo a professor at Harvard was arrested for ties to China, his lab assistant was a high ranking member in the Chinese military, he was given money to setup a lab in Wuhan China. The trade deal that works greatly against China is only paused in a national emergency. Joe Biden's son was on the board of a Chinese company, one of the major reasons no Dem would be voted into office is the economy doing so well. You take a biological weapon and release it into society you can stop a trade deal, manipulate your currency to help crash the economy, spread it to other nations and have the media talk about it non-stop causing mass panic and the U.S. markets to crash and blame it on Trump to hopefully get a Dem elected that cant even remember what fucking office he's running for. . Oh and China is trying to blame it on us and what's the first thing you do if you release a biological weapon into your own country to stop the uprise against your regime? Blame your biggest adversary. Notice how Biden was doing terribly until the rest of them dropped out and he got all their delegates?

In a televised address on the coronavirus epidemic, the man who began his presidency two years ago as a liberal Europeanist reappeared as a Charles de Gaulle-style nationalist. Both the future of France and future of Macron\u2019s presidency rest on how well he negotiates this transformation.\n\nThe speech, watched by a record-breaking number of people \u2014 some 35 million viewers \u2014 was set at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, against the spare backdrop of a gilded wall and French and European Union flags. Dressed in his habitual blue suit, blue tie and white shirt, Macron spoke for 20 minutes, explaining the precautionary measures the government had already taken and urging the French to obey them. Too many people, he admonished, were still going to markets and parks, restaurants and bars as if \u201clife had not changed.\u201d\n\nBut life, he warned, had changed \u2014 changed as greatly as it had in times of war. Indeed, this was the speech\u2019s leitmotif: Macron repeated the phrase \u201cWe are at war\u201d six times, to underscore not only that France was no longer the same but also that he was no longer the same. \u201cThe day after we emerge victorious,\u201d he promised, \u201cwill not be like the day before.\u201d\n\nThis change becomes clear when we recall Macron\u2019s first two years in power. His persistent effort to scale back the acquis sociaux, or social benefits that French workers had won over the past century, was met by equally persistent resistance. It issued not from France\u2019s shattered and scattered political left, but instead from grass-roots movements like the \u201cyellow vests.\u201d Their weekly protests have faded, but the structural and economic reasons for their disaffection and disconnect remain. His attempt to reform France\u2019s pension system \u2014 a series of proposals that included standardizing and raising the retirement age \u2014 also resurrected the moribund unions, whose strikes succeeded in paralyzing the nation\u2019s transportation networks for several weeks this past winter.\n\nThe government outlasted the strikers, but its victory was Pyrrhic. Even though it retreated on several issues, it ultimately forced through a diluted reform bill with the help of a constitutional article that allows the government to suspend parliamentary debate and enact laws in exceptional circumstances.\n\nNow, that controversy seems to belong to another era. It turns out there are few things like an existential crisis to reboot one\u2019s presidency and persona. In an astonishingly autobiographical passage of his speech, Macron declared: \u201cThis period will have taught us a great deal. It has swept away many of our certitudes and convictions, while others will be reexamined. Many things we thought were impossible will happen.\u201d\n\nAgainst this claim, consider the immediate postwar career of de Gaulle. A conservative Catholic military officer who scorned politics became the leader of a provisional government that adopted a revolutionary political agenda that, among other achievements, nationalized industries and enacted many of the acquis sociaux the unions are now fighting to defend. Like de Gaulle, Macron has pivoted 180 degrees. The Europeanist who was determined to liberalize the economy and rationalize the welfare state has been replaced by a nationalist determined to mobilize the economy and emphasize the need for a resilient welfare system.\n\nThis transformation was made clear when Macron affirmed French sovereignty by turning his back on the E.U.\u2019s monetary policy and opening the coffers of the treasury. (On Friday, the E.U. made de jure Macron\u2019s de facto decision by announcing the suspension of its tight budgetary policy.) In essence, Macron insisted that the state \u2014 the one largely built by de Gaulle \u2014 was ready to pay any price to keep the French safe not just from the viral contagion but also from the spiral of economic disaster. Completing the Gaullist transformation, Macron\u2019s minister of the economy subsequently announced that the government was prepared to nationalize key industries.\n\nIf Macron follows through, his speech could prove historic. In terms of style, many commentators have caught echoes of George Clemenceau, who led France during the final years of World War I, while others hear the voice of de Gaulle in his BBC address of June 18, 1940, when he declared the \u201cflame of resistance\u201d still burned in France. While the novel coronavirus is now winning the battle of France, the French would eventually win the war. But as Macron also made clear, victory could be achieved only by a \u201cunited\u201d France.\n\nThe events that have unfolded since Monday reveal that Macron\u2019s metamorphosis and call to unity have convinced a majority of the French. But there are majorities and there are majorities, and Macron\u2019s is anything but massive. In a poll taken the day after the speech, more than 75 percent found Macron\u2019s words convincing, yet since then a bare majority of French \u2014 54 percent \u2014 are satisfied with the government\u2019s handling of the epidemic.\n\nMacron will have to improve on that if he wants to live up to the legacy of de Gaulle.", "subreddit": "europe", "created_utc": 1584866306, "author": "casualphilosopher1", "link_id": "t3_fmwqrn", "parent_id": "t3_fmwqrn", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": true, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": true, "trust": true, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fjx0pdx": {"body": "1 in 10 will die.\n\nChina now has no excuse not to attack Australia.\n\nMuch bigger picture.\n\nAnd A S I O and other huge sub civil companies ie security and telstra / western power and many more.

Snopes:  True.\n\nThey did.  Quit lying about it.  See, that's a problem with this  administration.  They lied about what they did.  They continue to lie about what is going on now, and why in hell should we believe anything they say now?  What are they going to do?  Say, \"yes we were lying back then, and yes we lied about everything else, but right now we are telling the truth?\" \n\nYou listened to the address -- not a single one of your (my) accounts of what was said was accurate.  Let's see shall we:\n\nTrump:  \"We will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days. The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight. There will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings.\u201d\n\nReality:  Ken Cuccinelli - acting Dept. Secty for Homeland Security - three hours later -- Correcting the President -- \"The travel restrictions don\u2019t apply to American citizens or legal permanent residents or their families.\u201d  The President's address created immediate bedlam in Europe as people scambled for tickets out of Europe since the President literally just said they would be there for 30 days.  I have a kid in Europe now -- the day before the State Dept had said that anyone could choose to leave, but it was not necessary.  Then the President spoke and tens of thousands of Americans scrambled to try and get a way out of Europe the next day.  Now, presumably, embassey and others were calling rational people in the admininstration to try and get a handle on what the hell was going on.  It took a few hours and then word came out  that the President was wrong.  Americans could still get back.\n\n2.  The President said:  \u201cThese prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval. Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing.\u201d\n\nThis too was just flat out wrong.  Futures markets collapsed.  Market stops were hit, and hit again, and hit again.  See -- people listen to what a President says.  Would the cargo of auto parts on the ship porting in the morning be allowed to unload.  Port authorities needed to know if it applied to ships in port, or just those coming after the speed.  Union officials needed to know if their workers should unload ships.  What happens to goods in cargo planes in transit?  Oops -- sorry.  What he apparently meant to say was ????.  Nothing.  When the markets collapsed and phones blew up someone apparently said -- \"Hey, guess what, business people are pissed.  Maybe we should take back that rule.  Maybe it wasn't a good idea to let Ivanka and Jared and Stephen tell the President what to say.\"  Interesting that it actually took less time for the President to say, \"I didn't mean it\" for the European goods statement than to get a correction out about -- you know -- Americans in Europe not being allowed to travel.  That certainly says something about what the President thinks concerning the relative value of people versus trade.  Incidentally, the trade correction came out from the President.  The people correction came from the acting deputy secretary for Homeland Security.  What do you think that says about what the President cares about?\n\n3.  The President said:   \u201cEarlier this week I met with the leaders of the health-insurance industry who have agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments.\u201d  Nope.  A spokesperson for the health insurance lobby said:  \"Co-payments for coronavirus testing, not treatments, have been suspended.\"  Huge difference, but, of course, we can't get tests anyways, but that is a whole other set of Trump lies.\n\nThat's three lies in a 9 minute 30 second address made from the oval office at a time when the American people and the world were on edge.  How important was it?  Well - -markets collapsed within minutes.  People in Europe who the day before were literally told by the state department that this was fine -- not an issue in staying, were now told they had 24 hours to get home or they would have to stay for 30 days unless they passed testing which, today, we still have not figured out.  (Florida, a state of 21.5 million people should breach the 1,000 tests done mark today.  They were over 700 yesterday.)   Literally the day before -- Trump said there was nothing to worry about.\n\nThis was an address from the oval office.  It is not a press conference.  It is not a \"hey I was thinking about this\".  The President speaks to the American people and the world from the oval office.  You cannot get things wrong.  You cannot float ideas.  Globally people listen and take immediate action.\n\nThe World Health Organization got the initial report from China on December 31, 2019.  It declared a world health emergency on Janaury 30, 2020 -- hey that's one day BEFORE the US stopped Chinese citizens from traveling to the US (but not US citizens or green card holders, or students)\n\nBy the time the President gave his address we were already in a crises and had been since no later than January 30.  Thanks to this President and his asinine lack of response -- we are now in full market collapse, city wide lock-downs, and cancellation of schools and colleges across the country and we are staring at numbers right now of somewhere between 1% and 4% of all Americans dying from this disese.  That's 3,200,000 people on the low end.  12,800,000 on the upper end.  A lot depends on the ability to develop, produce and distribute vaccines to everyone -- worldwide. \n\nRight now -- companies as diverse as Ford and GM are looking at shifting production to making respirators/ventilators for use around the world.  Good for them.  We need to ramp up wartime production if we are going to get through this.  And -- we need someone who is not a bumbling idiot to help lead the country.

Says that whilst we will probably look back at it and say our early failures in testing prevented containment of the virus, from where we are now we can only really control and Britains strategy is bold and intelligent (though not without risks). Though it focuses a little too much on the herd immunity thing, which is more just a cosnequence of the government's plan (if any substantial immunity is available), but not the main plan itself, but it does explain why the government is using this strategy rather than stricter quarantines. \n\n&gt;One of my favourite aphorisms concerns two archetypal doctors \u2013 one a surgeon, the other a physician \u2013 confronted by a patient with a life-threatening emergency. \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there, do something!\u201d shouts the surgeon. \u201cDon\u2019t just do something, stand there,\u201d the physician replies.\n\n&gt;Originally a humorous encapsulation of the different character traits typifying these two very different branches of medicine \u2013 surgeons, decisive people of action; physicians, cerebral theorists \u2013 it strikes me the aphorism could be repurposed to describe the divergence in the management of the coronavirus pandemic emerging between the UK and the rest of the world.\n\n&gt;Numerous other countries, many with far fewer confirmed cases than us, are imposing restrictions on the gathering and daily movement of their people, as well as banning immigration. The UK did have its own case-based containment phase, but last week it officially shifted to a delay phase. At present this consists largely in voluntary efforts: self-isolation in the event of respiratory symptoms; good hygiene practices; and a degree of social distancing and home-working.\n\n&gt;This approach has received widespread criticism, including from professor John Ashton, a former regional director of public health, and from senior figures in the World Health Organisation. These are not voices to be dismissed lightly. And faced with a serious public health threat, it does feel unnerving not to be employing stringent counter-measures. Surely we should be closing schools and universities, limiting travel and public events? (A ban on mass gatherings is expected from next week.) Shouldn\u2019t everyone with a temperature or cough be being tested? That would feel like we were doing something. And in some countries, such as China, South Korea, and Singapore, these kinds of approaches have brought new case numbers down impressively.\n\n&gt;Dealing with this pandemic is going to be a marathon, however, not a sprint. Underpinning UK strategy is the conviction that the virus is not eradicable by containment. Covid-19 is a perfect storm of a pathogen. It causes minor enough illness in most patients to make it hard to detect and therefore isolate every case, meaning it spreads itself very effectively. Once strict population-based containment measures \u2013 which severely curtail normal life and are not sustainable long-term \u2013 are lifted and people start travelling and mixing again, it won\u2019t be long before coronavirus resurges. \n\n&gt;Superimposed on this is the tendency for viral infections to come in waves, typically peaking in winter months. And unlike the 2009 pandemic of swine flu, which had an exceptionally low mortality rate (around 0.02 per cent), Covid-19 has the capacity to send at least 5 per cent of affected people into intensive care, many of whom won\u2019t survive. The accounts coming out of Italy this past week are a chilling demonstration of what happens to a health system hit by a sudden surge of critical cases \u2013 it has been utterly overwhelmed.\n\n&gt;If coronavirus can\u2019t be eradicated by containment, and if, unchecked, it will completely outstrip our capacity to care for serious cases, then the best way of managing it is to gain some control over the timing and rate of the inevitable infections. This is the UK\u2019s ambitious strategy \u2013 to flatten and draw out the first wave.\n\n&gt;Think of coronavirus cases as water flowing through a hose. Population-based containment would be like pinching the pipe so hard that you shut it off completely, but the force required can\u2019t be maintained forever; soon muscles fatigue and cramp, and the water starts up again. What the UK is attempting is to regulate the flow. At present the water pressure (new case numbers) is low, so relatively little force is needed to limit the flow rate \u2013 these are our current low-key tactics. As water pressure rises, the hose needs to be squeezed harder to keep the flow rate controlled \u2013 these will be the institutional closures, event cancellations, and travel restrictions we\u2019re told may come.\n\n&gt;If successful, the UK will reach next winter with a substantial proportion of the population immune to Covid-19, while having maintained the capacity to care for severely affected patients in intensive care units along the way. The anticipated second wave next winter will be dramatically attenuated. \n\n&gt;But there are huge uncertainties. No country has ever tried to regulate the rate of a pandemic in this way before.

We have come to believe recessions and depressions are inevitable, but I believe they aren't inevitable. \n\nThis latest recession, like others before it, was due to greed run rampant. Rampant Greed isn't inevitable.\n\nTax laws have been written which allow money made via investment in the stock market to be be taxed less than money earned. This is particularly advantages to the Investor Class.\n\nMany CEOs are chosen by boards because they are willing to pump most Company profits into the stock market. \n\nThey are rewarded by receiving big bonuses in stock which often (generally?) far outstrip their salaries. So for instance a CEO might make 1.5 million in salary while receiving 20 million in stock. \n\nThe more the company stock goes up, the greater the CEOs personal compensation.  Also the greater the compensation for all investors, like Warren Buffet, etc. \n\nI wrote that obvious fact to lead to this... The stock market isn't just the happy recipient of almost every drop of Company profit, it is also being goosed with low interest loans readily available to those esteemed Mega-Corps. \n\nSo why not take out massive loans of `nearly' free money and put them into stock buy backs? After all such a practice makes the CEO richer, and it makes the board, representing the investor class (like Buffett), smile. The Company looks golden to others who then put their money (or money they have borrowed), into the market.\n\nIt's win win win right? \n\n We have had a historic number of years of low cost money now and never before have our Corporations been so leveraged for the benefit of so few (only 10% own 80% of the stock).\n\n When a market is so debt based even a sneeze (from Coronavirus for instance) can send investors running for the exits.\n\n Are unfortunate events like a pandemic inevitable? Sure, however, the pandemic itself isn't the cause of collapse. It's the weakened state of being highly leveraged which renders Corporations unable to weather any vicissitude which causes the collapse. \n\nIt caused failure in the late 1920s, in the 80's, in 2000, in 2007-8 and apparently again in 2020! Do we never learn? \n\nAh well, why should they learn? The Bankers and Corporations aren't too fearful of being so leveraged because they can count on the American taxpayer to bail them out to the tune of, well, whatever it takes...no one ever seems to ask how we'll pay for that. We'll just do it... \n\nWhy? \n\nBecause our Legislators have been bought and paid for by these Corporate entities.\n\n Our younger generation have been caught into a life destroying debt trap, forced there, not by greed, but by necessity. They had to pay the excessive costs of higher education in order to get jobs that didn't amount to flipping burgers. \n\nSimultaneously, these Corporations were getting money for nearly free, students were paying interest rates of 7-8%. When, through no fault of their own, students can't pay back their loans, they are treated ruthlessly while CEOs, who've padded their personal wealth based in pumping &gt;all&lt; profits into the market and precariously leveraging the Company via gargantuan loans, again to enhance their bottom lines even more obscenely get bailed out. \n\nIs this inevitable?\n\nNo...\n\nWhen Investment Banking was well regulated and Corporate Monopoly laws were enforced America enjoyed a time of steady, stable growth of middle class incomes and well-being. So, these kinds of booms and busts *aren't* inevitable. \n\nHow long will this continue? \n\nAs long as campaign finance laws allow the Wealthiest to buy our legislators. As long as the American people remain naive to what is going on. \n\nHow can it be fixed? \n\nWe need an FDR type of leader who can put together a team of real geniuses like Robert Reich and others who can craft a game plan going forward. A game plan NOT based in Corporate greed, but rather based in what is good for Society in general.\n\nIs this Socialism?\n\nAren't these Corporate bailouts Socialism?

And what the president hears on Fox News often dictates his own pronouncements and policies \u2014 which, in turn, are glowingly represented in Fox News\u2019s coverage and commentary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat\u2019s never been anything short of dangerous, since the effect has been to create a de facto state-run media monster more devoted to maintaining power than shedding light on the truth. But now the mind-meld of Fox News and Trump is potentially lethal as Trump plays down the seriousness of the coronavirus and, hearing nothing but applause from his favorite information source for doing so, sees little reason to change.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere\u2019s one person who could transform all that in an instant: Fox founder Rupert Murdoch, the Australian-born media mogul who, at 89, still exerts his influence on the leading cable network \u2014 and thus on the president himself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAD\n\nADVERTISING\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChris Wallace, the independent and tough-minded Fox News interviewer who serves as the network\u2019s chief reality officer, has revealed that the executive chairman of News Corp and co-chairman of Fox Corporation likes to give feedback on what he sees on the network.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cHe cares tremendously about the news,\u201d Wallace said, according to the Guardian. \u201cWhen I have contact with him, he never is asking about ideology, just: \u2018What\u2019s going on? What\u2019s happening? Tell me.\u2019 \u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat\u2019s a little hard to believe, given the network\u2019s long history of Clinton-bashing and birtherism lies about Barack Obama, and its peddling of conspiracy theories. But Murdoch\u2019s ultimate power at the network is not in question.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConservative pundits blame a grab bag of supposed villains amid the coronavirus outbreak\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo imagine if the word flowed down from on high that Fox News should communicate to Trump that he needs to take an entirely new tack on the virus. Imagine if Murdoch ordered the network to end its habit of praising him as if he were the Dear Leader of an authoritarian regime and to instead use its influence to drive home the seriousness of the moment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAD\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould it matter? No doubt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe network\u2019s influence on Trump is clear from the presidential tweets that follow fast on the heels of a Fox News broadcast. He was always a fan of Fox News, but after entering the White House, he made it even more of an obsessive daily habit, Bloomberg News reported in 2017, to the extent of blotting out dissenting voices from other sources.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTrump made specific reference to his reliance on Fox News during his misleading press event Friday, when he offered unwarranted reassurance rather than urging extreme caution and decisive action: \u201cAs of the time I left the plane .\u2009.\u2009. we had 240 cases \u2014 that\u2019s at least what was on a very fine network known as Fox News.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe message: Go about your business, America, and it will all disappear soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDays later, 30 deaths and more than 1,000 cases have been reported in the United States, with those numbers expected to grow exponentially. (By contrast, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is telling hard truths: As much as 70 percent of that country could end up being infected.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAD\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMatt Gertz, a Media Matters senior fellow and the foremost chronicler of the insidious Trump-Fox News feedback loop, connected the dots: \u201cRoughly an hour before his comments, a Fox News medical correspondent argued on-air that coronavirus was no more dangerous than the flu; a few hours later, the same correspondent argued that coronavirus fears were being deliberately overblown in hopes of damaging Trump politically.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe added: \u201cThe network's personalities have frequently claimed that the Trump administration has been doing a great job responding to coronavirus, that the fears of the disease are overblown, and that the real problem is Democrats and the media politicizing the epidemic to prevent Trump's reelection.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Fox Business Channel, host Trish Regan drew widespread condemnation for her over-the-top rant in Trump's defense: \u201cThe chorus of hate being leveled at the president is nearing a crescendo as Democrats blame him and only him for a virus that originated halfway around the world. This is yet another attempt to impeach the president.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAD\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(By contrast, her Fox News colleague Tucker Carlson has taken the threat seriously, though using it as an excuse to stoke anti-China sentiment along the way.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTucker Carlson issues a dire coronavirus warning. His audience expects nothing less.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the opinionators such as Regan and Trump whisperer Sean Hannity who are at fault. The news segments \u2014 while certainly more tied to reality \u2014 seldom push back in a meaningful way against the Trump message.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Tuesday, news anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum docilely sat back and lobbed soft questions while the president\u2019s son Eric praised his father\u2019s crisis-management skills and blamed liberal media figures who criticize him: \u201cHe could cure cancer tomorrow and they\u2019d say it wasn\u2019t fast enough.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven if all that changed today, great harm has already been done. As The Washington Post and others have documented, the administration has repeatedly squandered chances to prepare for and manage the global epidemic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAD\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut every moment still counts. Lives can be saved by prudent practices and aggressive government action \u2014 and lost by their absence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut it takes leadership from the top. And so, let\u2019s acknowledge the obvious: There is no more important player in influencing Trump than Fox News. And no more powerful figure at Fox than its patriarch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMurdoch might consider, too, that with the median age of Fox\u2019s viewers around 65, they are among the most vulnerable to the virus\u2019s threats.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor Fox News, a late-breaking change of heart might finally combine a wise business decision with what\u2019s good for the world.", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1583968662, "author": "C3R3B3", "link_id": "t3_fh6ahj", "parent_id": "t1_fk93yvg", "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": true, "disgust": true, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": true, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fi32mr0": {"body": "As far as I know, before they changed some stuff on the site, this was people who had potential trace contacts or had been in same areas as known affected.

There are around 1k-10k of in the US with the coronavirus right now (pessimistically, let's say 10k). As a wild approximation, we'll say that ~500k people in the US have the flu right now (based on ~10 million getting it a year). Now, suppose that the only things that cause a fever are the flu &amp; coronavirus and that we want to diagnose someone that has a fever. Even if all coronavirus cases and only 20% of flu cases develop a fever, that leaves us with 10k people with (coronavirus &amp; fever) and 100k people with (flu &amp; fever), meaning that if all we know is someone has a fever that it's much more likely (~10:1) that they have the flu than the coronavirus. This [symptom chart](https://i.insider.com/5e6a58e684159f61963287a2?width=700&amp;format=jpeg&amp;auto=webp) seems informative.\n\nThis type of problem is [conditional probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability) \"the probability of X given that Y is true\", typically written P(X | Y). The key insight is that P(X | Y) and P(Y | X) are not particularly related, especially when P(X) and P(Y) are of significantly different sizes. This is a common enough mistake to have a [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_of_the_inverse). For instance, imagine how \"is very wealthy - top 0.1%\" and \"owns a house\" interact. By definition P(rich) = 0.1%. At a guess, say P(house) ~= 50%. Almost all very wealthy people own a house: P(house | rich) ~= 99%, but it's obviously not the case that almost all people that own a house are very wealthy: P(rich | house) ~= 0.2%. To stay on theme, P(hungry | stoned) is a lot higher than P(stoned | hungry).\n\nIn this case, P(fever | covid) is high (~88%), but our initial estimate of P(covid) is so low compared to P(flu) that observing a fever isn't enough to convince us that someone with a fever has covid - P(covid | fever) isn't that high. On the other hand, while P(shortness of breath | covid) &lt; P(covid | fever), P(shortness of breath | flu) is much, much lower, so P(covid | shortness of breath &amp; fever) is much, much higher than is intuitive.", "subreddit": "worldnews", "created_utc": 1584172905, "author": "alkalimeter", "link_id": "t3_fi91qc", "parent_id": "t1_fkgfg3h", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": true}, "complete": false}, "fizx0em": {"body": "Yes, I've also observed that people from developed countries have delicate constitutions.

Recently, Wuhan has rushed to build three \" square cabin hospitals \" overnight . Lead to cross-infection with more serious consequences. On the 6th, a video was uploaded on Twitter. A person in charge of the suspected Fangcai Hospital personally told the truth. Some netizens said that the explanation was plain, the Fangcai Hospital was a funeral home , and they died here when they entered. They could not come out.\n\n\nAs the epidemic situation in Wuhan continues to deteriorate, beds in major hospitals are difficult to find, and many patients cannot be treated. In addition to the temporary \"Vulcan Mountain Hospital\" and \"Thunder Mountain Hospital\" previously built, Wuhan rushed to build three nights on February 3. \" Fang cabin hospital \" is specially used to treat diagnosed mild patients.\n\nThe three \"cabin hospitals\" are Wuhan International Convention and Exhibition Center, Wuhan Hongshan Gymnasium and Wuhan Living Room, with a total of more than 4,000 beds. However, the \"hospital\" has neither isolation protection facilities nor medical equipment.\n\nSome netizens said: \"I'm afraid that I can get in such a place, and I can't get out!\" Some netizens worry: \"I'm afraid the virus inside will mutate again.\" \"The medical care here is dangerous.\"\n\nOn February 6, a netizen posted a video on his Twitter account and attached a post, \"The person in charge said: Fangcai Hospital is not a hospital at all, there are no medical facilities in it, and it does not accept people with severe illness or mobility problems. And when you go in, you can't come out ... To put it bluntly, the Fangcang Hospital is a funeral parlour . The patients received here will no longer be treated, just wait for death! \"\n\n\nMany netizens have commented on this video and said, \"Everyone is lying together waiting for the collective killing of the dead hospital.\"\n\n\"If you have a mild patient, if you don't let go of the worsening treatment, you just have to wait for death.\"\n\n\"It's a temporary dormitory, okay. Call the crematorium for temporary expansion.\"\n\n\"A demon has built a slaughterhouse, and it is very difficult to tell everyone that this is the slaughterhouse. The onlookers asked the devil: Can you accept me? The devil still said in dilemma: fast to die and not to die. You can only collect people who are likely to die. If you come in together and wait for death, you will not let them out. If you are not mentally disabled, you will be angry and sad and wait for a hammer! \"\n\nAnother Twitter netizen posted a WeChat screenshot sent by a patient from Wuzhan Fangcai Hospital . The WeChat patient said that he entered the Fangcai hospital in the early morning of February 6, 1,000 confirmed patients, a toilet, someone has urinated anywhere, Spitting. Now a lot of people are talking about dying and dying at home, and now they don't know how they died. We are sick and have not sinned!\n\n\nOn the 6th, a netizen's post on Weibo also disclosed the actual situation of Wuzhan Fangfang Hospital . The post said: My aunt is a newly diagnosed patient with new coronary pneumonia in Qiaokou District. She was sent to a private hospital for isolation and treatment at 9 pm yesterday, and was woken up at 3 am to say that she was sent to a large hospital with better conditions. Arrived at Wuzhan Fangcai Hospital. The conditions here are very poor, which is not exactly what the news says.\n\nThe post said: The hospital's electrical wires were short-circuited and blacked out, the electric blankets were unavailable, and they slept with chills at night; One thousand people shared a toilet, and no one cleaned it. The patient's feces spilled out of the pit; breakfast was served at 10 o'clock in the morning, a few small snacks, and the Chinese food was unknown.\n\nI haven't seen doctors and nurses registering their illnesses and giving out medicines. They have limited manpower and they can't get busy. The oxygen inhalation equipment is seriously lacking. There is no bottle of oxygen in the ward of hundreds of people. In this case the patient's condition will only worsen. I implore the government to improve the conditions as soon as possible. Don't take it lightly because the patient is currently mild, and mild patients also have human rights! Everyone wants to live!\n\n\nIn response to criticism from outsiders \u2019hospitals, Mr. Zhang, a netizen in Wuhan, told NTD:\u201c It will be repaired in a few days. This is the so-called Communist Party \u2019s effort to run this kind of hospital. The hospital has no equipment and no There are no protective facilities, no treatment facilities, and no medical equipment. They just isolated him and waited for death. It was a death camp. \"\n\n\nIt is reported that from February 4th, Wuhan will build another 8 \"cabin hospitals\". In addition, there are 20 \"square cabin hospitals\" from all over the country who are helping Wuhan and mobilizing 2,000 medical staff across the country.\n\nWuhan netizen Mr. Tu said, \"There are too many people infected, and then the hospital is not enough. This is the only way, but the effect of this isolation is not very good.\"\n\nHe also said, \"The period of high incidence is almost coming. The government must have concealed it. There must be hundreds of thousands of cases across the country. The government does not dare to report it. Who dares to say it. If you say it, he said you made a rumor. He can detain you, often seeing a lot of people telling the truth and then being detained. The dictatorship and one-party dictatorship are too terrible. \"\n\n(Reporting by reporter Luo Tingting / responsible editor: Wen Hui)", "subreddit": "China_Flu", "created_utc": 1581063531, "author": "HandPie4Me", "link_id": "t3_f05hco", "parent_id": "t3_f05hco", "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": true, "disgust": true, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": true, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fkfzinn": {"body": " Notable Quotes:\n\nJanuary 22: \u201cWe have it totally under control.

Being an unwilling participant in the rat race, and as a possible consequence burn out. It really just sucks that for the vast majority of the working populace, more than 50% of our waking time (from a per week perspective) has to be spent for work purposes. When taking into account other arguably necessary activities such as sleeping, morning exercise, chores, and main meals, there's such precious little free time to just let your mind wonder and simply do nothing that I'll be damned if I use that time to do something useful.  \nOther unnoticed things like work prep, commute to work, and the added delay due to context switching involved between each of these activities per weekday also add up, and the cost isn't just the time lost, but also the physical and mental energy required to do them. I get that one can see these as opportunities for their self improvement (e.g. learn a foreign language during commute, or learn something useful whilst on the job), but it would never be as flexible or as optimal (at least for me) as just doing that from home, with a fresh mental state unmarred by work prep or commute.  \nI know that there are some who manage to avoid the rate race, and I say good for them. But like, dang, just knowing that I won't get to that state of Financial Independence for another (hopefully just) 10 years really tires me out.  \n\n2. As someone born in the early 90s, I'll be one of those that will have to cope with the increasingly detrimental effects of Climate Change, and to see [current leadership](https://youtu.be/cOmdkN6MOwU) from some of the biggest countries deny it outright or prioritize other goals, [even after seeing the effects firsthand](https://youtu.be/6BmbvTvFQ3g), keeps giving me existential dread. It's just one piece of bad news after the other, and I've been exposed to the point of apathy, not even depression. Well at least the coronavirus has reduced CO2 emissions from China for a bit.  \nSure, the announcement to fully migrate to EVs by 2040 is nice, and the rising popularity of Solar Panels is also cool, but it's still another 15-20 years of CO2 emissions - we need to go Carbon \\*\\*Negative\\*\\* by 2030 to avoid the point of no return. Also, the majority of our power mix is still Natural Gas, and of course that's better than burning Coal, but it contributes. It just sucks that Nuclear Energy isn't even a talking point here anymore, considering (at least from casual reading here on Reddit) the latest innovations in Nuclear Energy have Passive Nuclear Safety, can utilize Thorium as a fuel which is apparently 3 times more abundant than Uranium, Liquid Fluoride Coolant which is supposedly safer than traditional Water Cooling, Small Modular Reactors for decreased land usage, good energy to fuel wastage comparatively, etc...

(Cant find it at the moment)\n\nA lot of users chimed in confirming they were in a similar situation.  Immediately I    connected the dots and concluded that the \u201cFacebook crowd\u201d  was unusually not discussing this at the least! They lack peripheral vision when it comes to world events and have thus made the whole of Facebook a circle-jerk of people laughing out anyone brave enough to suggest that it\u2019s better to be ridiculed for being prepared and not need the provisions than to later be ridiculed for not taking action should mass hysteria and human nature kick in.\n\nNow, me and my family live in one of the safest places in the world to be during such an occasion, on an island in the Baltic sea, but JUST IN CASE SH1T HITS THE FAN me and my S/O have been making trips to the stores, and little by little gathering canned and dry goods, medical previsions, food for our pets and some cleaning and hygiene supplies. In just three days we\u2019ve built up a stockpile that should last the three people living in the house, two cats, a large dog and 20 fish in the aquarium for at least 2 months.\n\nIncluding a tank full of gas, this all cost us just around 400\u20ac. That\u2019s for 3 people and a tiny zoo for 2 months. And in no way is this wasted money! IF it turns out the sky isn\u2019t falling and the apocalypse gets canceled this time around (as it has been so many times before!) will we not be able to make use of the food? Will the gas in our car get rancid in 2 months? Will the pets suddenly not require feeding? NO! These things will come in handy even if everything turns out to be OK!\n\nThe first two days were quite calm, business as usual... nobody was buying canned goods, nobody was buying bottled water but today we got our first national scare, as two (TOTALLY HEALTHY) Chinese tourists in our capital were forced to go to the ER. At 1:30pm the local supermarket parking lots were full, all but two carts were in use and most of the cheaper canned goods were almost out of stock. Staff members were stocking rows of 5  liter water bottles in isles and everyone seemed on edge. A LOT of  local men work overseas in an already infected region and most of them visit home on weekends...\n\nNow, all this being said, the statistics of this outbreak are still too fresh to make any  serious conclusions, in any case it would seem that for a previously healthy young(ish) person the likelihood of dying from nCoV2019 if infected is relatively low. But a lot of rumors and fearmongering is going on, people are starting to panic. And IF the statistics start showing exponential infection rates outside of China, mass hysteria and public unrest will follow! In conclusion, I am more concerned about the public reaction to nCoV2019 than the virus itself.\n\nIn light of all this I\u2019ve created a Facebook page where I try and keep the common folk objectively updated on the situation and educate them on best practices to be ready to deal with this situation. The page is a work in progress and as I have nothing better to do, I\u2019ll be working on it like a full time position.\n\nI collect data from different groups and trusted news sources all over the internet, from Reddit and from global and national organizations and always link my sources. I avoid political and religious discussion and will not tolerate polarization or xenophobia in the comments.\n\n**I  wholeheartedly hope this post/comment will not be deleted as my goal isn\u2019t to steal anyone's thunder and in no way will I be profiting from this effort. My goal is to spread awareness and help people understand this situation for what it is and clear up the panic that has started to rear its ugly head among people who might not even know what Reddit is.**\n\nFeel free to join and invite your friends and family as well. There is absolutely no need for   panic as that would only complicate the global efforts to contain this outbreak.\n\nDon\u2019t be scared, be prepared! :)\n\n[http://facebook.com/ReasonablyPrepared](http://facebook.com/ReasonablyPrepared)  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL/DR:\n\n1.

This is an extremely rare phenomenon, but the liberals in this country would have you think it is always the case. When the antifascists (Antifa as they have become so fondly known as to erase the thing they are against from public perception) break windows, they are quickly dubbed \"domestic terrorists.\" Black Lives Matter protestors are treated the same way. And these are the more radical examples in our country. A far cry from the direct action of these two groups is the campaign of Bernie Sanders. Yet even he and his supporters are accused of being \"uncivil\" for a lack of better criticism.\n\nThis is representative of a certain blindness or perhaps voluntary ignorance from liberals: ignorance of the violence embedded in the status quo. This violence is central to the American identity and has a strong monetary and social incentive to not be mentioned. Yet sometimes this violence becomes blatantly obvious, and if you are a keen observer it becomes dauntingly omnipresent as time passes. It is most visible in the stories of police brutality that we are exposed to every day. It is very obviously visible in every single \"foreign policy action\" the United States partakes in. Yet I'll try to provide some of the more \"invisible\" examples:\n\nIt is visible when President Obama has the audacity to fly out to Flint, Michigan, drink water for a photo op, and then leave the people to fall ill or pay thousands for the bare necessity that is water. It is visible when a few deaths from the novel Coronavirus that bring losses for the shareholders are publicized much more than the 20,000 daily (preventible) worldwide deaths from starvation will ever be. It is visible when the only black group in American history to ever arm themselves for self-defense based on their 2nd amendment rights are slaughtered by the FBI. It is visible when that same FBI injects minority neighborhoods with guns and drugs and then stars the \"war on drugs and crime\" which has become synonymous with the \"war on blacks and browns.\" It is visible when the specter of slavery lives on through our prison system that incarcerates and exploits those same \"blacks and browns.\" It is visible when even our \"Democratic\" leaders (e.g - Clintons) exploit those prisoners\u2019 labor for their own gain, not unlike every capitalist in America. It is present when those same Democratic leaders and many more men in positions of socioeconomic power are able to get away with sexual harassment and assault. It is visible when both flavors of political party agree to send a $3 Billion stipend to Israel for the massacring of Palestinians. It is visible when companies like Nike present a theme of social justice and activism attached to their products that have been made through the exploitation of workers in the Asia-Pacific. It is present when every product we consume has in one way or another been touched by the exploitation of the third world that we perpetuate with our horrendously inflated military. It is visible when both parties reconcile their differences in order to continue funding said exploitation with &gt;$700 Billion a year.\n\nAs soon as this injustice is exposed, claims of being \"uncivil\" rear their ugly head. Bernie Sanders for decades now has been one of the few to expose and challenge the status quo, going as far as being arrested at civil rights rallies that would certainly be deemed \u201cuncivil\u201d today. The people he represents have been the most touched by this violence and to demand their civility is to completely and utterly silence their voice. It is to say \"Hush! Your cries for freedom are inconveniencing me.\" It is apparent that those who bask in the all-forgiving aura of the status quo don't have to apologize for the injustices I mentioned and many more. To support this status quo and demand civility from the same people you meet with deadly force and systematic oppression on a daily basis is laughably hypocritical, yet through manufactured discourse and punditry it has been made almost instinctual for the privileged.\n\nTo conclude, I'll expand upon one of my favorite quotes of all time from Rosa Luxemburg. \"Those who do not move, do not notice their chains.\" And those who are priveleged enough to not have to move too often complain about the noise created by those yearning to be free from their chains.", "subreddit": "neoliberal", "created_utc": 1583333122, "author": "jombozeuses", "link_id": "t3_fdduny", "parent_id": "t1_fjgpsu4", "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": false, "disgust": true, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": true, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fkr8rmz": {"body": "I relate to this so heavily girl.

The reason why, was we were actually in the middle of moving to Seattle, when Seattle started getting their first couple cases. He was moving out there first and I was going to ship all of our belongings and move out at the end of the month (seems to be end of April... maybe even May now). I was in a hard position because I knew even in FEBRUARY, that by the time this hits the US we would probably be hit while he was Seattle and I was prepping to move. I told him every prediction I had, they all cane out true, but in the moment in February, and even beginning of March, he didn\u2019t want to hear any of it. It didn\u2019t hit him until the night before he got on his flight to Seattle, his parents called him and begged him not to go, and that the company he was moving there to work for (Amazon) had a positive covid19 developer in a building down the street from him. THEN it hit him like a ton of bricks. He still made the move, which he had to, and like I said i was mentally preparing since February, he\u2019s been working from home since he\u2019s arrived and we\u2019re all good now, but I understand how hard this is. It\u2019s like nothing can get the point across from it, this sounds fucked up but one of his CO WORKERS had to be infected for my boyfriend to wake up.

You\u2019re already a step ahead. You also are being smart in picking up those certs. If you have any knack for programming or code languages, then you may also look into AI to hedge future bets. \n\nThere was (is?) a significant demand for qualified developers. I\u2019ve had a mostly terrible experience trying to find reliable developers around here. \n\nBut we don\u2019t yet know how much this pandemic will upend, so the business environment\u2014with its needs and demands\u2014may look different afterward. \n\nI have a feeling AI is a sure bet, because it is already starting to become proficient at jobs in media/marketing industries (i.e., website development, SEO, analytics, digital marketing, etc.). I have always resisted only doing web development to keep my skills diversified. Up here in the Colorado Rockies, there are very few people who specialize in the web development that I can offer. It\u2019s lucrative, but what happens when something interrupts normalcy?\n\nI don\u2019t know you, obviously, but if AI doesn\u2019t sound appealing, then I would suggest leaning into a creative talent that also produces good content. Generalized creativity is one of the last bastions of AI development, so if you have those such skills and talents, then there\u2019s much you can do into the foreseeable future. \n\nFor example, so many fucking people think they are graphic designers because they watched a couple of videos and have photoshop. And sadly, stupid clients hire them, which usually leads to disaster for idiot clients. \n\nWhen I offer my services, my education, and a robust creative portfolio, back me up. I tend to get higher quality clients who appreciate well-thought design and are willing to pay for it. \n\nSo my point here is that if you have a creative talent or skill, you may want to invest some time and attention in becoming a master of it. Strong creative ability will help you stand out and can also insulate from AI encroachment...for now. It's also great for digital marketing and social media. ;)\n\nSpeaking of gyms, I got fucking ripped after the 2008 meltdown. I suddenly had time on my hands and extreme frustration, which I worked out. An older friend even told me that all dudes in their 20s need are food and a gym membership.

Well, I guess I can start us off on a hopefully-productive-note. Edit: Oh three comments by the time i finished typing. Mild credentials: I have some expertise with logistics and previously tried to calm people down during the Ebola scare in 2014, as well as some minor research in bacteria and the like. I also live in one of the [dense red zones in California, close to San Fran.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html) \n\nCalifornia's planning is.. messy. It's difficult to tell what city or county has what plans or programs in motion, and a lot is done without communication between branches. It can be hard for the average citizen to simply become aware actions are being taken and what their role in it can or should be. The following suggestion may be entirely redundant to you if you live in an area where the issue is covered already or redundant, but for those not so fortunate: \n\nI would propose a reminder that the people maintaining electricity, water, internet connections, etc. have families too, and cannot simply \"not go to work.\" Our infrastructure goes down and it's back to the dark ages. In times of emergency that causes shortage of goods or the halting of supply or manufacture of them, the \"infrastructure service\" should receive a stipend of non-cash material, based off the triggered shortages, and role - such as expanded sanitation and protection provided for people expected to interact with others or the items of others.\n\nIn summary: The garbage-men, grocers, and related handlers should be given sanitation materials. People maintaining water plants, nurses, doctors and the like should receive a stipend of canned foods and consumables based on family size (as a quick slapdash temporary solution if no more accurate metric is available, *I am not implying that two people with different diet needs can be given the same items ofc*). I am *NOT* proposing cash aid. I am merely proposing that, we have the luxury of being able to communicate and plan and discuss and debate, using an internet connection or a phone, and this is a *luxury* that is provided by someone's labor. Measures should be taken to ensure that labor source is not stuck fearing for their family's future or savings because some scalper is charging $20 for a toilet roll. \n\nHow such a program could be arranged, especially given the current shortages, I suppose that's up to a lot of debate and discourse and the answer may vary from city to town to county, and vary based on laws (and I am no lawyer). Ideally, I would suggest that a local governing body, if the central governing body is proving inactive, should utilize tax money (or donations if so fortunate) to create a \"rainy day bank\" - of long-shelf-life canned goods and similar materials, based off the average population's consumption of such goods over the course of a month. Should the items begin reaching the extent of their shelf life (however long it may be), they are then replaced by a newer item, and the previous one nearing the end of its cycle placed into circulation for immediate use, sold as a local-government-surplus in order to recoup expenses and lessen tax burden. Such a measure should be applied for any risk of scarcity, and this protection would not be limited to simply an outbreak or quarantine, but other more common and more probable emergencies such as earthquake.\n\nIdeally cooperation with the Federal government would be possible and this could include such things as military MRE's and other materiel, which I believe has justified use in times such as this. \n\nHow exactly such a stipend / bank / rainy-day-fund / etc. etc. like the above could work, how to raise funds for it, how to recoup losses on those funds to lessen the expense, etc. in any specific individual area, that part I cannot answer as I do not have the requisite legal skills. It may not even be acceptable for a governing body to use tax-purchased items to lower expenses (via selling items) in some areas, and I am not familiar enough with the various local city rules, regulations, laws... I have been contemplating calling my local mayor and discussing the above system and ask if we could get some mil surplus or some other sort of import from other areas of the country, etc, etc,. and trying to make this above idea that I came up with over the past few hours a reality.. I'd hoped to provide a more useful suggestion than \"write/call your local official\" or \"talk to a lawyer\" which may be nebulous and unhelpful., and the answer may be different for others... though hopefully the idea itself, the concept, can be adapted by you, the reader - to fit to your situation and needs and capabilities. Maybe it can be done in one area via local gov, maybe in another it has to be done independently by a few people getting together and planning with out-of-state associates to do it privately, I cannot answer which will be best for which region. \n\n...though on the other hand I did make this after being awake through all of last night and havn't been asleep since earlier yesterday-morning, so perhaps sleep deprivation blinds me to some obvious flaw in my suggestion (aside from the shortage of items to put in the bank as an immediate solution, since that's what the whole importing or cooperation with mil/central was about). I apologize if my post is overly-verbose; I passed 30 hrs awake a while ago and I am aware it dulls my mind. \n\nA bit too tired to type out full list of economic ideas on raising funds for / obtaining item imports for, said bank/rainy-day-materials/materiel. Shorthand suggestions of immediate function: \n\nWash your hands thoroughly. Consider use of things such as eye protection, people rub their eyes habitually and you do not know what kind of silly mistake you'll make due to sheer force of habit. Humans are imperfect creatures of habit. You may consciously think \"oh, I'll wash my hands\" and then suddenly you're rubbing your eyes or scratching your nose. Put a redundancy in place to cover for your habits that may normally be beneficial but in this case may harm you. Maybe that's disposable gloves, maybe that's sunglasses on a cloudy day, I don't know. I just know that humans that are hungry, thirsty, horny, sleepy, etc. are prone to massive lapses in judgement. \n\nBe aware of human limitations. Don't devolve into a beast.

Not going to bother articulating why each of your points in incorrect, because arguing against people who are obviously incredibly biased usually ends up being a circle jerk. Let's go through your comment. \n\n&gt;Trump has not implemented any policies that had a significant impact on the economy.\n\nPure conjecture, you aren't providing any evidence. \n\n&gt;All he has managed is to not fuck up growth that was already happening. \n\nAgain where is the evidence for this? \n\n&gt;And he comes with the added nuttiness of behavior like this, and Ukraine, and Soleimani, and Syria. Everything he does is a knee-jerk decision that he and his administration have to scramble to rationalize later.\n\nYou are way too emotional In your argument. Despite the \"nuttiness\" of those situations, nothing \"nutty\" has come out of it. \n\nNow let me explain why Trump is a safe bet. First off, **im not a Trump supporter**, I am simply explaining the situation. His deregulation of the economy has resulted in economic growth, despite what you said. His trade wars have not damaged the economy anywhere near as much as what was predicted by the liberal media, and they actually seem to be working. I mean just look at the position China is in, there is not a better time to leverage China for better trade policies than now, they are dealing with HK, Uygher camps, and the coronavirus it's a perfect time to pressure them into trade reforms. \n\nDespite his aggression towards Iran, we aren't (and not going to be) at war with Iran, or involved in any new major conflicts overseas. \n\nHe is the safe bet. Now I'll explain why Bernie is not a safe pick. Despite people saying his policies are not radical, they indeed are. Completely reforming healthcare, immigration, climate, and education is indeed radical. The majority of these reforms will result in increased taxation across the board, for policies that may not even be effective. \n\n\nI'm not arguing that Bernie's policies are bad (except his immigration policies, which I will certainly say are terrible) I actually agree with them. My point is that they represent risk to the voters, and that risk is for good reason.

Levitt did not discover a treatment or a cure, just did what he does best: crunched the numbers. The statistics led him to the conclusion that, contrary to the grim forecasts being branded about, the spread of the virus will come to a halt.\nThe calming messages Levitt sent to his friends in China were translated into Chinese and passed from person to person, making him a popular subject for interviews in the Asian nation. His forecasts turned out to be correct: the number of new cases reported each day started to fall as of February 7. A week later, the mortality rate started falling as well.\n\n\nHe might not be an expert in epidemiology, but Levitt understands calculations and statistics, he told Calcalist in a phone interview earlier this week.\n\nThe interview was initially scheduled to be held at the fashionable Sarona complex in Tel Aviv, where Levitt currently resides. But after he caught a cold\u2014\u201dnot corona,\u201d he jokingly remarked\u2014the interview was rescheduled to be held over the phone. Even though he believes the pandemic will run its course, Levitt emphasises his support of all the safety measures currently being taken and the need to adhere to them.\n\nLevitt received his Nobel prize for chemistry in 2013 for \"the development of multiscale models for complex chemical systems.\" He did not in any way intend to be a prophet foretelling the end of a plague; it happened by accident. His wife Shoshan Brosh is a researcher of Chinese art and a curator for local photographers, meaning the couple splits their time between the U.S., Israel, and China.\n\nWhen the pandemic broke out, Brosh wrote to friends in China to support them. \u201cWhen they answered us, describing how complicated their situation was, I decided to take a deeper look at the numbers in the hope of reaching some conclusion,\u201d Levitt explained. \u201cThe rate of infection of the virus in the Hubei province increased by 30% each day\u2014that is a scary statistic. I am not an influenza expert but I can analyze numbers and that is exponential growth.\u201d At this rate, the entire world should have been infected within 90 days, he said.\n\nBut then, the trend changed. When Levitt started analyzing the data on February 1, Hubei had 1,800 new cases each day and within six days this number reached 4,700, he said. \u201cAnd then, on February 7, the number of new infections started to drop linearly and did not stop. A week later, the same happened with the number of the deaths. This dramatic change in the curve marked the median point and enabled better prediction of when the pandemic will end. Based on that, I concluded that the situation in all of China will improve within two weeks. And, indeed, now there are very few new infection cases.\u201d\n\nLevitt compared the situation to bank interest\u2014if on the first day a person receives an interest rate of 30% on their savings, the next day of 29%, and so forth, \u201cyou understand that eventually, you will not earn very much.\u201d\n\nThe messages his friends translated quickly made waves in China and people wanting to make sure he did indeed write the information attributed to him started contacting Levitt. \u201cThat is how I knew I needed to continue,\u201d he said. \u201cI could have said, yes, that\u2019s what I said,\u2019 and left it at that.\u201d", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1584221866, "author": "RedJohnIsBacc", "link_id": "t3_fipyoq", "parent_id": "t3_fipyoq", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": true, "optimism": true, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": true, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fl54mzj": {"body": "Just as a personal anecdote, here\u2019s a timeline of each member of my aunt\u2019s family in Wuhan (whom I suspect might\u2019ve all gotten infected at some point).\n\nFather-In-Law: Showed severe symptoms in late January. Hospitals were overrun by then and he couldn\u2019t get himself checked. Stayed at home with his wife (Mother-In-Law), and because they are both elders, my aunt, her husband, her sister-in-law and her brother-in-law took turns to bring them food and they ate together.

Slept in the same bed and ate on the same table as father-in-law throughout.\n\nAunt: Showed slight symptoms (no fever, only cough) that persisted for 2 weeks days after eating together with father-in-law.

Northern Town of Italy with 3000 Pop. Real life experiment conducted to test every single person. 3% (89) tested positive. Worryingly, \"asymptomatic or quasi-symptomatic subjects represent a good 70% of all virus-infected people\". Full and voluntary self quarantine (not just self isolation). 9 days later 6 tested positive and trending towards zero. Zero Community Transmission. Clinical mortality is substantially lower than real life mortality.\n\nThe researchers conclusion is ....\n\n\" In the absence of specific therapies or a vaccine, quarantine, distancing and identification of asymptomatic carriers remain the only real measures to control this epidemic.  \"\n\nAt first you may think this is impossible to be applicable to major cities or the horse has bolted, myself and even the article acknowledges the former. However here's what I think are some obvious and less obvious takeaway. \n\n(1) This is **measurable** proof of asymptomatic or quasi-symptomatic positives. You can tell a less informed, irresponsible person who has close contact with and cares about a person of high risk of COVID19 mortality the risk the danger they pose even if initially they don't have symptoms.\n\n(2) When I scenario build out how COVID19 will play out in future, I cannot escape the conclusion that closed countries, closed internal borders and quarantines will persist for the next 12-18 months regardless of what all governments are telling us now. COVID19 will leak through the weakest link in any quarantine (think Sub Sahara Africa) and it is impossible for COVID19 to be eradicated short of something akin to a worldwide roll out of a working vaccine like the smallpox vaccine. So the only choice to minimise the impact is actually to ramp up testing kits, aside from ventilators and personal protection equipment (PPE). \n\n(3) Expanding on testing. Some governments are already giving up on increasing testing, however that's an incorrect strategy. One effective strategy is to repurpose manufacturing capacity (with the vast numbers of coming jobless) to ramp up delivery and testing analysis. Testing methods and technologies will continue to improve. Human desperation and ingenuity will drive this. South Korea tests 20,000 a day already, with improved techniques, additional resources and a war footing - a tenfold increased in capacity is entirely possible and then it takes 275 days to test everyone in South Korea 55 Mil / 200k tests. You kill a giant in many, many small steps - and you get your neighbours to help out. (we sold 1.56 billion smartphones in 2018 - mass production is more powerful than most people understand)\n\n(4) Once testing capacity exponentially increase, governments should test all health workers, and all arrivals first regardless of symptoms, then break the country into smaller components be it shire, council, province, town, suburb etc, test everyone there and slowly identify green zones, keeping strong quarantines to protect these greenzones from outside visitors while letting life and the economy recover in these green zones. To illustrate, Parts of China, Taiwan are effectively green zones already.\n\nThe population will baulk at the more and more imposition of freedoms, but think about historical war situations and even the day by day changing of your own mindset through COVID19, if explained well the population will do the right thing in time when there's an existential threat (not to humanity but definitely to our current way of life that's underpined by the economy). Can we really afford a big chunk of our population to not work for 12-18 months? notwithstanding the direct and indirect terrible human toll.\n\nIn short, don't give up on a strategy to ramp up testing a hundred fold or more. If may seem insurmountable and impossible today, I point you towards historical human mobilisation from the World War 2 efforts and the building of Pyramids...\n\nTake care and stay safe.", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1584823267, "author": "WWBSkywalker", "link_id": "t3_fmfa26", "parent_id": "t3_fmfa26", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": true, "pessimism": true, "sadness": false, "surprise": true, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fhkvf0r": {"body": "What they're talking about is [antibody dependent enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody-dependent_enhancement).\n\nIf, like Dengue fever, COVID-19 has multiple serotypes, it's possible that getting infected a second time could be worse.  In simple terms, let's say your body gets into a fight with some kid.  After a while, your body realizes that this kid always leads by kicking with his left foot.  You win the battle.

Considering that droplet transmission viruses (like the one causing COVID19) often require larger droplets than that, these masks could be even more effective against this particular virus.\n\nQuote:\n&gt; Any type of general mask use is likely to decrease viral exposure and infection risk on a population level, in spite of imperfect fit and imperfect adherence, personal respirators providing most protection.\n\n---\n\n[International Journal of Infectious Diseases](http://archive.is/1Mwcb) - This one shows surgical masks preventing the wearer from being infected when living with someone who has the flu.\n\nQuote:\n&gt; We found compliance to be low, but compliance is affected by perception of risk. In a pandemic, we would expect compliance to improve. In compliant users, masks were highly efficacious.\n\n---\n\n[Journal of the American Medical Association](http://archive.is/cvUQ7) - This study of 446 nurses in Ontario hospitals showed that n95 masks and surgical masks offered similar protection from viral infection for the wearer.\n\nQuote:\n&gt; Our data show that the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza was similar in nurses wearing the surgical mask and those wearing the N95 respirator. Surgical masks had an estimated efficacy within 1% of N95 respirators.\n\n---\n\n[National Institutes of Health](http://archive.is/GMOaG) - Surgical masks offer almost as effective filtration efficiency against simulated particles as n95 masks.\n\nQuote:\n&gt; The in-vivo filtration tests illustrated that N95 respirators filtered out 97% of potassium chloride (KCl) solution, while surgical masks filtered out 95% of KCl solution.\n\n---\n\nAnd for the coup de gr\u00e2ce, here's one published in [Emerging Infectious Diseases](http://archive.is/spCh6) (the journal of the CDC) with a juicy quote:\n\n&gt; We present the results of a prospective clinical trial of face mask use conducted in response to an urgent need to clarify the clinical benefit of using masks. The key findings are that &lt;50% of participants were adherent with mask use and that the intention-to-treat analysis showed no difference between arms. Although our study suggests that community use of face masks is unlikely to be an effective control policy for seasonal respiratory diseases, **adherent mask users had a significant reduction in the risk for clinical infection**. Another recent study that examined the use of surgical masks and handwashing for the prevention of influenza transmission also found no significant difference between the intervention arms (12).\n\n&gt; Our study found that only 21% of household contacts in the face mask arms reported wearing the mask often or always during the follow-up period. Adherence with treatments and preventive measures is well known to vary depending on perception of risk (27) and would be expected to increase during an influenza pandemic. During the height of the SARS epidemic of April and May 2003 in Hong Kong, adherence to infection control measures was high; 76% of the population wore a face mask, 65% washed their hands after relevant contact, and 78% covered their mouths when sneezing or coughing (28). In addition, adherence may vary depending on cultural context; Asian cultures are more accepting of mask use (29). Therefore, although we found that distributing masks during seasonal winter influenza outbreaks is an ineffective control measure characterized by low adherence, **results indicate the potential efficacy of masks in contexts where a larger adherence may be expected, such as during a severe influenza pandemic or other emerging infection.**\n\n---\n\nBut even if you choose to ignore the science, and even the CDC's own study... do you think that there wasn't a single cough from someone in the hours they waited in line in OP's picture?

So, it is no longer as important to test. During the containment stage, identifying infected cases, isolating them and attempting to figure out who they came into contact with was important. Now, the cat is out of the bag. We know the virus is spreading everywhere, so finding all of the cases isn't as important.\n\nWe're at the delay stage. We need to slow the virus down. That means if you are actively sick, you isolate yourself as much as possible. Even if you aren't actively sick, the less everyone moves around in their community the better. The goal now is to slow the virus down as much as possible to increase the chance that local hospitals can deal with those who need critical care. The more we slow it down, the more people will survive.\n\nSo, at this time, you only need a test if you are very ill and likely to need hospitalization. If you are mild to moderately ill, you can take care of yourself at home. Just like when you have the flu. Going to see a doctor in order to get tested is just going to expose more people to germs, potentially expose you to secondary infection, and tie up valuable resources. All medical staff now need to focus on critical cases.\n\nThe important thing for people to remember is there *are no medications* for the coronavirus. Even if you insist on seeing a doctor and get tested, you are not going to receive a prescription. They are just going to be able to tell you, \"yeah, you have it\".

So, if it's something I've known for awhile, I'm going to put (me) to identify that thing. I'm not an expert or anything.\n\nYou shouldn't take a fever reducer such as tylenol, aspirin or ibuprofen when you have the virus. Yes, it will reduce your fever, your aches and pains, and generally make you feel better. However, your immune system works much better when your body temperature is high. You will have a greater chance of fighting off the virus if you leave your fever alone and allow your body to do its job.   (me) I haven't heard any actually numbers for this, but I plan to leave my fever alone unless it reaches 103 degrees.\n\nMedications like Mucinex aren't supposed to be effective for the virus. (me) But I haven't heard that it will do any harm to take an expectorant. I am \\*assuming\\* that taking some Mucinex to mentally feel as if I've done something to help myself will be okay. I would be careful about taking cough suppressants. Mucinex is an expectorant, it's supposed to thin mucus in your respiratory tract so that your body can cough them out. However, cough suppressants that make you stop coughing are supposed to increase your chances of developing pneumonia. This is \\*just\\* general stuff that I learned years ago.

But the virus has spread so quickly that by Wednesday, 22 countries on three continents had announced school closures of varying degrees, leading the United Nations to warn that \u201cthe global scale and speed of the current educational disruption is unparalleled.\u201d  \n\nStudents are now out of school in South Korea, Iran, Japan, France, Pakistan and elsewhere \u2014 some for only a few days, others for weeks on end. In Italy, suffering one of the deadliest outbreaks outside China, officials said Wednesday that they would extend school closures beyond the north, where the government has imposed a lockdown on several towns, to the entire nation. All schools and universities will remain closed until March 15, officials said.\nVIRUS UPDATESRead the latest news and analysis about the coronavirus outbreak here.\nOn the West Coast of the United States, the region with the most American infections so far, Los Angeles declared a state of emergency on Wednesday, advising parents to steel themselves for school closures in the nation\u2019s second-largest public school district. Washington State, which has reported at least 10 deaths from the outbreak, has closed some schools, while on the other side of the country in New York, newly diagnosed cases have led to the closure of several schools as well.  \nThe speed and scale of the educational tumult \u2014 which now affects 290.5 million students worldwide, the United Nations says \u2014 has little parallel in modern history, educators and economists contend. Schools provide structure and support for families, communities and entire economies. The effect of closing them for days, weeks and sometimes even months could have untold repercussions for children and societies at large.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re always saying, \u2018When can we go out to play? When can we go to school?\u2019\u201d said Gao Mengxian, a security guard in Hong Kong whose two daughters have been stuck at home because school has been suspended since January.\n\nIn some countries, older students have missed crucial study sessions for college admissions exams, while younger ones have risked falling behind in reading and math. Parents have lost wages, tried to work at home or scrambled to find child care. Some have moved  children to new schools in areas unaffected by the coronavirus, and lost milestones like graduation ceremonies or last days of school.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have data to offer, but can\u2019t think of any instances in modern times where advanced economies shut down schools nationally for prolonged periods of time,\u201d said Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.\n\nIn Hong Kong, families like Ms. Gao\u2019s have struggled to maintain some semblance of normalcy.\n\nMs. Gao, 48, stopped working to watch her daughters and started scrimping on household expenses. She ventures outside just once a week and spends the most time helping her girls, 10 and 8, with online classes, fumbling through technology that leaves her confused and her daughters frustrated.\n\nGovernments are trying to help. Japan is offering subsidies to help companies offset the cost of parents\u2019 taking time off. France has promised 14 days of paid sick leave to parents of children who must self-isolate, if they have no choice but to watch their children.\n\nBut the burdens are widespread, touching corners of society seemingly unconnected to education. In Japan, schools have canceled bulk food deliveries for lunches they will no longer serve, hurting farmers and suppliers. In Hong Kong, an army of domestic helpers has been left unemployed after wealthy families enrolled their children in schools overseas.\n\n\nJulia Bossard, a 39-year-old mother of two in France, said she had been forced to rethink her entire routine since her older son\u2019s school was closed for two weeks for disinfection. Her days now consist of helping her children with homework and scouring supermarkets for fast-disappearing pasta, rice and canned food. \u201cWe had to reorganize ourselves,\u201d she said.\n\n\nOnline and Alone\nSchool and government officials have sought to keep children learning \u2014 and occupied \u2014 at home. The Italian government created a web page to give teachers access to videoconference tools and ready-made lesson plans. Mongolian television stations are airing classes. Iran\u2019s government has made all children\u2019s internet content free.\nStudents even take online physical education: At least one school in Hong Kong requires students \u2014 in gym uniform \u2014 to follow along as an instructor demonstrates push-ups onscreen. Each student\u2019s webcam provides proof.\n\nThe offline reality, though, is challenging.  Technological hurdles and unavoidable distractions  pop up when children and teenagers are left to their own devices \u2014 literally.\n\nThira Pang, a 17-year-old high school student in Hong Kong, has been repeatedly late for class because her internet connection is slow. She now logs on 15 minutes early.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a bit of luck to see whether you can get in,\u201d she said.\n\nThe new classroom at home poses greater problems for younger students, and their older caregivers. Ruby Tan, a teacher in Chongqing, a city in southwestern China that suspended school last month, said many grandparents were helping with child care so that the parents can go to work. But the grandparents do not always know the technology.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have any way of supervising the children\u2019s learning, and instead let them develop bad habits of not being able to focus during study time,\u201d Ms. Tan said.\n\nSome interruptions are unavoidable. Posts on Chinese social media show teachers and students climbing onto rooftops or hovering outside neighbors\u2019 homes in search of a stronger internet signal. One family in Inner Mongolia packed up its yurt and migrated elsewhere in the grasslands for a better web connection, a Chinese magazine reported.\n\nThe closings have also altered the normal milestones of education. In Japan, the school year typically ends in March. Many schools are now restricting the ceremonies to teachers and students.\nWhen Satoko Morita\u2019s son graduated from high school in Akita Prefecture, in northern Japan, on March 1, she was not there. It will be the same for her daughter\u2019s ceremony at elementary school.\n\n\u201cMy daughter asked me, \u2018What\u2019s the point of attending and delivering speeches in the ceremony without parents?\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nFor Chloe Lau, a Hong Kong student, the end of her high school education came abruptly. Her last day was supposed to be April 2, but schools in Hong Kong will not resume until at least April 20.\n\n\nA Burden on Women\nWith the closings, families must rethink how they support themselves and split household responsibilities. The burden has fallen particularly hard on women, who across the world are still largely responsible for child care.\n\nBabysitters are in short supply or leery of taking children from hard-hit regions.\n\nThe 11-year-old son of Lee Seong-yeon, a health information manager at a hospital in Seoul, South Korea, has been out of class since the government suspended schools nationwide on Monday. South Korea has the highest number of coronavirus cases outside China.\n\nWorking from home was never an option for Ms. Lee: She and her husband, also a hospital employee, have more work duties than ever. So Ms. Lee\u2019s son spends each weekday alone, eating lunchboxes of sausage and kimchi fried rice premade by Ms. Lee.\n\u201cI think I would have quit my job if my son were younger, because I wouldn\u2019t have been able to leave him alone at home,\u201d Ms. Lee said.\n\nStill, she feels her career will suffer. \u201cI try to get off work at 6 p.m. sharp, even when others at the office are still at their desks, and I run home to my son and make him dinner,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I know there is no way I am ever going to be acknowledged for my career at work.\u201d\n\nFor mothers with few safety nets, options are even more limited.\n\nIn Athens,  Anastasia Moschos said she had been lucky. When her 6-year-old son\u2019s school was closed for a week, Ms. Moschos, 47, an insurance broker, left her son with her father, who was visiting. But if the schools stay closed, she may have to scramble for help.\n\n\u201cThe assumption is that everyone has someone to assist,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the case with me. I\u2019m a single mother, and I don\u2019t have help at home.\u201d\n\nEven mothers able to leave affected areas have trouble finding child care. Cristina Tagliabue, a communications entrepreneur from Milan, the center of Italy\u2019s outbreak, recently moved with her 2-year-old son to her second home in Rome. But no day care facility would  accept her son because other parents did not want anyone from Milan near their children, Ms. Tagliabue said.\n\nThe closings in Italy \u2014 which include day care in addition to schools and universities \u2014 are likely to create problems for parents nationwide.\n\nMs. Tagliabue has turned down several job proposals, she said, since she is unable to work at home without a babysitter for her young child.\n\u201cIt\u2019s right to close schools, but that has a cost,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government could have done something for mothers \u2014 we are also in quarantine.\u201d", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1583397229, "author": "Viewfromthe31stfloor", "link_id": "t3_fdsadg", "parent_id": "t3_fdsadg", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": true, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": true, "pessimism": true, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fkjd319": {"body": "Apparently you could beg for an exemption.

During early December, we'd already picked up some news about 10+ people catching a \"weird lung virus\" in Wuhan. At that time, only a couple of English outlets reported on it (out of interest, I googled a bit for it back then -- I could recover the articles from my browser history, but hard to find with a Google search now since \"corona\" and \"pneumonia\" give back too much recent pages).\n\nAnyway, skip forward a month, and now we're all worried (mother-in-law is back). We have family in Hunan, Beijing, and sadly, Wuhan as well (a city we have some very fond memories with). We've heard lunar new year is definitely not the same this year. Father-in-law has warned against posting in WeChat (\"spreading rumors\", even whilst being very objective and just warning them to be safe). Me and my wife are in Europe, and tried looking online at our typical pharmaceutical shops to get some masks to send over. Conclusion: (good) masks sold out (in Europe!).\n\nThere's one thing we're thankful for, and that's us bringing 20 N99 masks to China in 2017. Our family members never used them (tucked it into a cupboard), but we've urged them to use them now when they go outside. Meanwhile, we're shipping a new batch (ultimately found online, but might take a while to arrive) + protective goggles. It's relatively costly, but better safe than sorry, I feel (we're keeping a set for ourselves here as well).\n\nHowever, let me be clear -- speaking from where we are, outside of China: I don't think there's a reason to panic. But on the other hand, I know for a fact a lot of trouble could have been avoided if the local Wuhan admin jumped into the pond quicker. We were aware of this from about early December that something weird was going on. And given our history with the city, it's not the first time we see local politicians fucking it up over there. Wuhan could easily be a triple-A city next to Shanghai or Beijing. The only \"good\" to come out from this is that the central bureau will focus its sight closely on the administration there for the next couple of years.\n\nMy wish is this blows over soon and my family can rest easy. On the other hand: the moment the first case is confirmed in my country: I'm wearing that mask on the train. I'm teaching to 100s of students.

Residents already were unnerved by strange stories posted on Facebook and shared via text messages about helicopters secretly flying in sick patients, that the virus was grown in a Chinese lab, that someone \u2014 either the media or the government \u2014 was lying to them about what was really going on.\n\nThe quarantine plan hastily hatched by the federal Department of Health and Human Services was soon scrapped by President Trump, who faced intense pushback from Alabama\u2019s congressional delegation, led by Republican Rep. Mike D. Rogers. Americans evacuated after falling ill aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan would not be coming to Anniston, a town of 22,000 people in north-central Alabama, after all. They would remain in the same Texas and California sites where they were taken after leaving the cruise ship.\n\nWhat happened here over the past week illustrates how poor planning by federal health officials and a rumor mill fueled by social media, polarized politics and a lack of clear communication can undermine public confidence in the response to the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease named covid-19. The rapidly spreading virus has rattled economies worldwide in recent weeks and caused the deaths of more than 2,900 people, mostly in China.\n\nRead the latest news about the coronavirus\n\nThe panic and problems that burned through Anniston also provided a preview of what could unfold in other communities, as the spread of the virus is considered by health experts to be inevitable.\n\n\u201cTheir little plan sketched out in D.C. was not thought out,\u201d said Michael Barton, director of the emergency management agency in Calhoun County, where Anniston is located.\n\nAs local officials learned more, Barton added, \u201cWe knew then \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were in trouble,\u201d said Tim Hodges, chairman of the county commission.\n\nIn Anniston, local leaders were stunned to discover serious problems with the federal government\u2019s plan for dealing with patients infected with the virus \u2014 starting with how the patients would get to Alabama, according to interviews with county and city officials, along with business leaders who dealt with the federal response.\n\n\u201cI was shocked,\u201d Anniston Mayor Jack Draper said. \u201cI was shocked by the lack of planning. I was shocked by the manner in which it was presented to us.\u201d\n\nTwo HHS officials \u2014 Darcie Johnston, director of intergovernmental affairs, and Kevin Yeskey, principal deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response \u2014 said in a Feb. 23 meeting with local officials that the patients would be flown from California to the Fort McClellan Army Airfield in Anniston, according to multiple local officials.\n\nThe airfield was closed when the Army base was shuttered in 1999. Local officials said they told the HHS officials during the meeting the runway was in bad shape.\n\n\u201cThe more we talked,\u201d Hodges said, \u201cthe more holes we found.\u201d\n\nThe HHS plan also called for housing coronavirus patients at the Center for Domestic Preparedness, a FEMA facility on the old Army base and one of several redevelopment projects at the sprawling outpost.\n\nThe center has several brick dormitory buildings \u2014 behind tall black fencing \u2014 where federal officials planned for the patients to live. Federal officials even picked out the building they wanted to use for the first arrivals: Dorm No. 28, local officials said. A team of federal health workers would care for the patients and U.S. marshals would keep them from leaving the quarantine, local officials said they were told.\n\nThe dorms normally house emergency responders from around the country.\n\nBut the center doesn\u2019t have any special capabilities for handling infectious diseases, local officials said. The center is used for training. It has isolation hospital rooms \u2014 located in a former Army hospital building \u2014 but they are mostly just props, with fake equipment and light switches that exist only as paint on walls.\n\nMeanwhile, federal officials never contacted the town\u2019s hospital, Regional Medical Center, about handling covid-19 patients, said Louis Bass, the hospital\u2019s chief executive.\n\nYet HHS officials said in a statement released to the public Feb. 22 that patients who become seriously ill would be sent to \u201cpre-identified hospitals for medical care.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were surprised,\u201d Bass said.\n\nThe hospital does have eight negative-pressure isolation rooms, but patients with serious complications would need to be sent to a larger institution, such as Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, 90 miles away, Bass said.", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1583083033, "author": "mbalzer01", "link_id": "t3_fbx2ym", "parent_id": "t1_fj6yn0g", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": true, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": true, "sadness": false, "surprise": true, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "cwbvkzb": {"body": "The biggest first-world problem I see creeping up on people:\n\nPeople literally have no idea how to relax anymore.  \n\nIf you dropped people right into the middle of a Corona ad... they'd go stir crazy in less than 5 minutes, grab their phone, and log onto Facebook the whole time.  \n\nTo commune with nature and listen to the sound of the waves is literally far beyond the personal fortitude of most people.\n\nLosing our ability to slow down is a very scary prospect.\n\nLike seriously, you were bored to death and unhappy after a couple days in *Jamaica?*  If ever there was a place where you could, *cough cough* \"drift off,\" do what you want, listen to relaxing music, get some good exercise on the beach, be turned on with your partner, and watch interesting people making art...

So, the virulence is worse than the regular flu plus at least for the flu a significant amount of the population has a flu shot which will mitigate if not prevent one from catching it. \n\nOne unfortunate part of colloquial English is that we tend to use \"the flu\" interchangably with \"the cold\" or other illnesses. \"Oh man, I caught the flu and it knocked me on my ass for a day.\" \"Ugh, I had a really bad stomach flu and I shat for a day and a half\". No. Neither of those are the flu. I'm a healthy, active mid-40s guy and in January I had the flu for the first time in 15 years. I was absolutely miserable for 5 days and the thought of going to work was laughable. And that's with having had a flu shot in November and my being lucky enough to have a mild case.\n\nSo let's say this Coronavirus actually doesn't kill anyone. It's still a more infectious flu without any mitigation from a vaccine. Now if no preventative measures are taken at all huge swaths of the population will become sick very quickly. In modern capitalism there is almost no redundancy in the work force and having 10% of your coworkers call in sick for a week will impact productivity much more than 10% due to the reliance and expectation that everyone is doing their job and my task requires that your task be done which requires that Jane's task be completed and so on. Disrupt any of those and I'm screwed and so are the people relying on me completing my task. If there are 10% fewer workers to load grocery trucks at the warehouse, that leads to more than a 10% decrease of trucks being loaded. Same for factories in China. And if no preventative measures are taken, basically everyone will get infected and the supply chain effects will be massive. This does not even touch on the effects on hospitals and such, with huge amounts of people getting sick in a short period.\n\nNow, let's say we try to mitigate the effects by closing factories when an outbreak is suspected. Now that factory is producing zero products for whatever period of time. Those workers probably aren't making money. The incidence of the virus spreads out over a longer period of time which is good for the healthcare system but the impact on goods and services is even more severe. \n\nWe have not really felt the supply chain effects yet. They take time to trickle down to the consumer. Supply chain shortages + retail / warehouse laborers being out of work due to sickness or shutdowns will have massive economic effects that will affect us in an ever increasing manner for the next several months. That will lead to companies not wanting to spend money because they'll be struggling. That will lead to companies not hiring. That will lead to people having less money and spending less. That will lead to companies not wanting to spend money because they'll be struggling. It's a vicious circle.

If we can rush wartime weapons for a World War, we can convert factories to making masks and goggles. Taiwan immediately ramped up production once infections grew in their country. The same could be done in the US. Instead, because it costs money, we're telling people not to wear masks, which has led to problems.\n\nWe could divert funds and research from organization such as the army, space research, and and ancillary functions of the government, to begin mass research into a vaccine.\n\nInstead of waiting for a vaccine, we can begin trialing many drugs for treatment options that could lessen or reduce the case fatality rate as well as the severe symptoms. If we had some sort of treatment that could reduce or slow the effects of the virus, it would not be so dangerous.\n\nWe can hold mass information campaigns and try to educate people as much as possible about how the virus spreads, how transmission occurs, and the best mitigation strategies.\n\nI know that it seems hopeless, but infecting hundreds of millions of people is going to lead to countless deaths. There are other options that are available at the moment, but governments are pushing the herd immunity line because it gets everyone back to work and gets the economy's up to speed faster. The drum beat for mass infection will grow louder and louder as the money makers and people behind the scenes start to feel the hurt in their wallets. Your average person will be kindling for the fire that rages across the planet. We can't let this idea gain hold, even if the people that pull the strings want it to happen.\n\nLook at this like HIV. Back in the 80s, Reagan and the US government actually laughed at dying gay patients and ignore the effects of HIV until countless lives were lost. It only gained national attention once a little white boy died of a blood transfusion.\n\nIf the government continued on that trajectory into the 90s instead of changing fighting tactics, even more people would have died unnecessarily. of course as you know we do not have a vaccine for HIV, so what we did was treated through alternative methods. We got the word out to vulnerable populations and began mitigation strategies such as teaching people how to use protective gear. While we distributed prophylactics, drug manufacturers began researching treatments such as AZT. We began being more careful with blood transfusions and patient contact protocols with bodily fluids. While we did not completely eradicate HIV, and while it still kills many, many people, if we completely ignored it, the results would be even more catastrophic. Instead, now, we live with it as a fact of life, and have molded our behaviors and treatments around it, while researchers look into new medicines.\n\nThere are people out there in the world that are actually immune to HIV. Theoretically if we had everybody infected with HIV, the people left behind would be immune. But how many dead people would it take to reach that end goal? Instead, we teach people how to wear condoms (PPE). We hold classes in every high school that tell people about...genital social distancing.\n\nHow many dead people is it going to take to reach the herd immunity goal for the coronavirus? We can stack enough corpses to climb to that goal, sure. But who is going to be one of the steps?\n\nOf course comparing coronavirus to HIV in terms of its lethality is not an accurate comparison. However, the situation regarding prevention and mitigation strategies is similar. It requires a mass education campaign, and a retooling of the way that we do things.

This is an additional ring in comparison to the 3-ring system used during the SARS outbreak in 2003 by the Vietnamese MoH:\n\nRing 1: The infected patients (F1) and family members (potential F2) are quarantined at the local hospital quarantine zone. Ring 1 will not accept any new patients unrelated to covid-19. Hospital staffs are also locked in. If a case goes bad, the ambulance and medical staffs stationed nearby will ship the patient immediately to the central level hospital. Electronic reports. The AC is turned off in case the virus can spread to other parts of the building by the central HVAC like SARS and MERS. Windows are opened for fresh air and sunlight.\n\nRing 2: The potential F3 - the people who have had close contact with the potential F2, are quarantined in group at the newly prepared temporary military base equipped with the necessary medical equipment. Health check is done every day by the local militia, the soldiers, and the military medical staffs at base. Medical staffs and ambulance stationed nearby will ship cases showing symptoms to Ring 1. No AC. Windows are opened for fresh air and sunlight.\n\nRing 3: The potential F4 - the people who have had close contact with the potential F3, are quarantined at home. Health check is done every day by the local militia, the soldiers, and the local healthcare professionals.\n\nRing 4: The entire commune has to pass health check at the posts surrounding the commune and goes to the sanitizing process of having sanitizers spraying all over their faces and objects. In the case that someone outside of ring 3 shows symptoms, the entire ring 4 will be on complete lock down. Surrounding the commune, the military corp and military medical staffs assigned to the job stand on guard outside the commune for health check post, giving people emergency treatment for other health emergencies, and shipping people inside the ring outside if they\u2019re not infected and have other health emergencies to other nearby healthcare facilities. Additional standby groups of soldiers, military medical staffs, and logistic corps are stationed around the B\u00ecnh Xuy\u00ean district and around the V\u0129nh Ph\u00fac province for emergency mobilization (i.e. in case the cluster escapes the S\u01a1n L\u00f4i containment). Field hospitals are built nearby just in case.\n\nAll confirmed cases\u2019 houses are sanitized and closed off for 14 days.\n\nStaffs in the rings are equipped with PPE. Civilians in the rings are given free medical masks.\n\nFood and other essentials for the staffs and the civilians are taken care of by the logistic corp according to military standard. Transportation of food and other essentials in the rings is conducted by the militia and soldiers stationed inside each ring.\n\nVietnamese nationals returning from infected areas are quarantined at temporary military barracks similar to the people in ring 2. But now with the patients encouraged to work out in the open fields too.\n\nCured cases, especially super shredder cases like the F1 who started the S\u01a1n L\u00f4i cluster, are continued to be quarantined in hospitals just in case unless they\u2019re not Vietnamese nationals and are accepted back by their home countries.\n\nAll schools in the country take the days off till (at least) the end of Feb.\n\nBorder transaction and transportation between Vietnam and China are severely limited even now (1 land border crossing facility -&gt; 3 land border crossing facilities in operation yesterday). In all 3 facilities in operation, the sanitizing process is applied to both the trains and the people driving the train. The drivers live in quarantine zones (ring 2 level of quarantine). All other Vietnamese official border crossing facilities and footpaths with China, Laos, and Cambodia are guarded by the local militia and military corps. All airports are close to mainland China. All people from outside country regardless of nationality have to go through the thermal scan and a healthcheck at the airport. People who have been to the epidemic regions within 14 days are barred from going to the country. The airport checking teams have the supporting team of medical staffs, soldiers, and ambulance on standby near the checkpoints. The gov might or might not expand the ban to other regions and countries depending on how the epidemic fares in other regions and countries. Edit:\n\nMedical mask distribution and sanitizers are prioritized to be shipped to the hospital system and people whose works put them at risk with the infection. Hospitals give out masks for free for patients. The rest are distributed to the market. Stores selling masks and sanitizers at too high a price compared to the original price are heavily fined by the local Market Regulation offices. Civilians are allowed to only buy a limited amount of masks (around 5\u201310 per person). Stores are allowed to only sell a limited amount of masks to each customer (around 5\u201310).\n\nThe national market and some significant chains are asked to save the products impacted by the border restriction with China.\n\nThe military, the Military Medical University, the MoH, other healthcare institutions and universities, and private Vietnamese enterprises are asked to cooperate with each other to study the virus, isolate the virus (successful, one of the first countries to do so), develop Vietnam\u2019s own testing kit (successful, RT-LAMP technique, 70 min), and eventually develop Vietnam\u2019s own vaccine (ETA 18 months at the earliest).

A distinct coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS. Recently, a metallopeptidase named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV. AlthoughACE2 mRNA is known to be present in virtually all organs, its protein expression islargely unknown. Since identifying the possible route of infection has major implications for understanding the pathogenesis and future treatment strategies for SARS, the presentstudy investigated the localization of ACE2 protein in various human organs **(oral and nasalmucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bonemarrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain)**. The most remarkable finding was the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine. Furthermore, ACE2 was present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied. In conclusion, ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, which might provide possible routes of entry for the SARS-CoV. This epithelial expression, together with the presence ofACE2 in vascular endothelium, also provides afirst step in understanding the pathogenesis of the main SARS disease manifestations.Copyright\uf6d92004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

So i dont think we need to wait a year. \n\n\n\"I'm sad to say that I do have the details, and there has been intense discussion about this over the past weeks. To answer your question: \"herd immunity\" would have been a beneficial outcome to slowing virus growth to a prolonged period of time. It was not a primary outcome.\n\nThat said, the official policy was wholly wrong and when all the dust has settled, when all the costs and lives have been counted, people have to make their governments accountable.\n\nI'll tell you what happened in the UK.\n\nOver the past decade, eminent figures in public health developed complex models that would help inform the UK response to a pandemic. The response plan would allow slow spread through a population and a number of deaths that would be deemed acceptable in relation to low economic impact. Timing of population measures such as social distancing would be taken, not early, but at a times deemed to have maximal psychological impact. Measures would be taken that could protect the most vulnerable, and most of the people who got the virus would hopefully survive. Herd immunity would beneficially emerge at the end of this, and restrictions could relax. This was a ground-breaking approach compared to suppressing epidemics. It was an approach that could revolutionise the way we handled epidemics. Complex modelling is a new science, and this was cutting edge.\n\nBut a model is only ever as good as the assumptions you build it upon. The UK plan was based on models with an assumption that any new pandemic would be like an old one, like flu. And it also carried a huge flaw - there was no accounting for the highly significant variables of ventilators and critical care beds that are key to maintaining higher survival numbers ([https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/health/2020/03/government-documents-show-no-planning-ventilators-event-pandemic](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/health/2020/03/government-documents-show-no-planning-ventilators-event-pandemic)).\n\nSo, come 2020 and COVID-19 causes disaster in China, Iran and Italy. Epidemiologists and doctors from around the world observe, and learn valuable lessons:\n\n1. the virus is insidious with a long incubation, any population actions you take will only have an effect weeks later\n2. the virus spreads remarkably quickly and effectively\n3. **the virus causes an unusually large proportion of patients to require invasive ventilatory support**\n4. early large scale testing, and social distancing measures, are effective at stopping exponential growth\n5. **stopping exponential growth is VITAL to preventing your critical care systems from being overwhelmed.**\n\nEveryone in the world could see these things. But despite this, very few governments chose to act.\n\nThe UK did the opposite of acting. In an act of what I see as sheer arrogance and British exceptionalism, they chose to do nothing, per the early stages of their disaster plan. There was some initial contact tracing, but this stopped when it was clear that there was significant community spread and exponential growth. And after this? They did not ramp up testing capabilities. They did not encourage social distancing. They did not boost PPE supply, or plan for surge capacity. They ignored advice from the WHO, public health experts in other country; epidemiologists, scientists and doctors in their own. I can tell you with certainty now that they did not even collect regular statistics for how many COVID patients were being admitted to critical care in the UK. They did nothing.\n\nWhat were they thinking? Maybe that what had happened in China, and was happening in Italy, couldn't possibly happen in the UK, right? It was **impossible**. And this plan that great minds had been planning for a decade, this was the perfect time to test it out!\n\nWell COVID-19 is not flu. That is perfectly clear. And it was clear that the UK numbers were following, exponentially, the same trend as Italy. But still the government and their advisers stuck to their guns and put out reassuring messages. I would ask here - **why did they still think we would be different?**\n\nFinally, a team at Imperial informing the government's response put up-to-date COVID-19 data into the historical models that the UK plan was based on ([https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf)), and predicted in a best case scenario 250,000 deaths and excess of 8x surge capacity of UK intensive cares. They concluded that our approach was wrong, and that \"Epidemic suppression is the only viable strategy at the current time\".\n\nWhere are we now?\n\n1. The government has instituted a number of measures that they previously called \"unscientific\", but has not mandated them.\n2. We are far, far into the exponential curve both in deaths and critical care numbers, and there is at least two weeks more growth until any of the half-hearted measures taken might kick in.\n3. We do not have sufficient testing capability for even hospital patients, who sometimes wait days for a test result. There are not enough tests for anyone in the community, or any healthcare workers who might have symptoms.\n4. Hospitals are scrambling to produce surge capacity, and several smaller hospitals in London are now overwhelmed with COVID and out of ventilators.\n5. There is clearly not enough PPE in the country and we are rushing to secure supplies.\n\nDon't believe the UK government propaganda when they say that they are only advancing along the same plan at a faster pace. It is total bollocks. Their plan was wrong, kaput, totally broken. They chose to perform an experiment on an entire population, a trial of 'new epidemic mitigation strategy in UK' vs 'epidemic suppression in rest of the world'. They refused to listen to experts from all over the world because of sheer arrogance, and in their arrogance they did not observe the lessons that were there, plain to see. **They have backtracked completely and are now doing what most world public health experts and what the WHO asked them to do in the first place.** They've wasted a month, at least.\n\nWill they suffer? Hell no. It will be the vulnerable in the population, the unlucky young, and the medical staff at the front line.\n\nWhen the final counts return in months or a years time, don't let them get away with it.\"", "subreddit": "newzealand", "created_utc": 1584982681, "author": "dracenois", "link_id": "t3_fmbsa7", "parent_id": "t1_fl522ag", "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": true, "disgust": true, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": true, "pessimism": true, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fldcxa7": {"body": "Yesterday\n\nIn my head the chaos happened in USA because of their health care system and low wages and what not and in Italy because of not taking precautions and the fact that old people often live close to children\n\nI come from a country with free healthcare, many of my friends study to become doctors and they have not freaked out, our old people mostly live in \"elderly homes\" and there is less items on the food shelfs but still enough to get what you need.

Stockmarkets have collapsed by a third and in many countries factories, airports, offices, schools and shops have been closed to try to contain the virus. Workers are worried about their jobs and investors fear companies will default on their debts. All this points to one of the sharpest economic contractions in modern times. China\u2019s gdp probably shrank by 10-20% in January and February compared with a year earlier. For as long as the virus rages, similar drops are likely in America and Europe, which could trigger a further downward lurch in Asia. Massive government intervention is required to ensure that this shock does not spiral into a depression. But scale alone is not good enough\u2014new financial tools need to be deployed, and fast.\n\nWestern authorities have already promised huge sums. A crude estimate for America, Germany, Britain, France and Italy, including spending pledges, tax cuts, central-bank cash injections and loan guarantees, amounts to $7.4trn, or 23% of their gdp (see Briefing). Yet central banks are responsible for over four-fifths of that and many governments are doing too little. A huge array of policies is on offer, from holidays on mortgage-payments to bail-outs of Paris caf\u00e9s. Meanwhile, orthodox stimulus tools may not work well. Interest rates in the rich world are near zero, depriving central banks of their main lever. Governments typically try to stimulate demand in a downturn but people trapped at home cannot spend freely. History is not much of a guide. The global pandemic of 1918 took place when the economy was wrecked by war. China has endured a lockdown but its social model is different from the West\u2019s.\n\nWhat to do? An economic plan needs to target two groups: households and companies. And it needs to be fast, efficient and flexible so that if the virus retreats only to resurge, workers and firms can be confident that governments will dial assistance down and up again as needed. Start with households, where large government spending is needed. One aim is to protect vulnerable people, by subsidising sick pay and ensuring those without insurance have health care. But spending is also needed to discourage lay-offs at firms running far below capacity, by subsidising workers\u2019 wages\u2014an area where Germany has led the way.\n\nhttps://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/985/85/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20200321_LDC815.png\n\nGovernments also need to jerry-rig digital systems so they are able to distribute cash to households directly, as Hong Kong hopes to. The aim should be to have the capability to ramp further support up and down quickly. Many places, including America, rely on sluggish postal services and tax agencies to distribute cash. If funds can be sent instantly through mobile phones or online bank accounts, people will feel more confident and avoid hoarding cash and slowing the recovery when the virus recedes.\n\nAll this spending will cost governments dear, but the fiscal stimulus of about 1% of gdp so far across Europe is clearly too low. America\u2019s plan to spend 5% is closer to the mark given the risk of a double-digit gdp drop. As fiscal deficits balloon, governments will have to issue piles of bonds. Central banks should step in to buy those bonds in order to keep yields low and markets orderly. Inflation is a second-order concern and there is little danger of it taking off. To prevent a euro-zone crisis, the European Central Bank plans to buy \u20ac750bn of assets. But it and European governments should also give a clear guarantee of sovereign support for Italy and other peripheral economies.\n\nThe second priority is to get cash to millions of companies, whose failure would damage the economy\u2019s potential. They face a cash drought even as bills fall due. Bond markets are closed to many of them. Mass defaults would fuel unemployment and bad debts at banks, and make it harder for commercial activity to rebound. Most governments have intervened, but in flawed ways. France says nationalisation is an option\u2014which firms will resist. America is propping up the commercial-paper market, but this funds only a fraction of all corporate debt and is used by big firms\u2014not small ones, which employ most people. Germany and Britain have offered loan-guarantee schemes but it is unclear who will process millions of loan applications. The best approach is to use the banking system\u2014almost all firms have accounts, and banks know how to issue loans. Governments should offer banks cheap funding to lend to their clients while guaranteeing that it will bear most of the losses. Borrowers could be offered bonuses for repaying loans early.\n\nThere are huge drawbacks to all of this. Public and corporate debt will soar. Handouts will be given to rich people and loans extended to firms that are badly run. But even with this fearful list of side-effects, the advantages are overwhelming. Cash will be distributed fast. Vulnerable people will be able to get by. Households will be confident enough to spend when conditions improve. And firms will keep their workforces and plants intact, ready to get back to action when this dark episode has passed.", "subreddit": "neoliberal", "created_utc": 1584873930, "author": "andanicechianti", "link_id": "t3_fmy14o", "parent_id": "t3_fmy14o", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": true, "pessimism": true, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fh2ayco": {"body": "In the case of SARS there were asymptotic or late-symptom- onset \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d such as Dr. Liu Jianlun who infected at least 16 other guests in a hotel where he was staying.

Use a suitable moisturizer for your hands after desinfecting them.\n\n\nAlright, let\u2019s see what we know about our ingredients:\n\n\n- Tea Tree Oil:\n\nLoads of studies have shown that we should keep this one closest to us during outbreaks, as it has a wide spectrum of properties, including: antifungal, antimicrobial, antiseptic, antiviral, and antibacterial.\n\n- Lemongrass Oil:\n\nSome say it\u2019s the boring cousin of Tea Tree oil, but with it\u2019s antibacterial and antifungal properties, you should always invite him to your party!\n\n- Lavender Oil:\n\nWell known antibacterial and antiviral product that has the benefit of smelling really fresh.\n\n- Peppermint Oil:\n\nThis is one of my personal favorites, as it dates back as far as ancient Greece. It has antibacterial properties, helps the skin and also keeps your hands smell fresh.\n\n- Vitamin-E oil:\n\nMoisturizer and it keeps the skin balance healthy in a 100% natural way.\n\n- Sage Oil:\n\nThis lil\u2019 baby already proved that it possesses antiviral properties during the fight against SARS. \n\n- Aloe vera gel:\n\nDoes pretty much the same job as the Vitamin-E oil, but it adds some antibacterial and antifungal properties to the mix.\n\n\nRecipe for 100 mL of DIY-hand sanitizer:\n\n- 25 drops of Tea Tree oil\n\n- 5 drops of Lemongrass oil\n       \n- 5 drops of Lavender oil\n       \n- 5 drops of Peppermint oil\n       \n- 10 drops of Sage oil\n\n- 15 mL Vitamin-E oil\n\n- 30 mL Aloe Vera gel\n\n- 50 mL 120 proof Everclear, grain alcohol(120 proof means 60% alcohol)\n\n\nNoteworthy:\n\n- If you want to make more than 100 mL, adjust the ingredients accordingly, but don\u2019t go too heavy on the Everclear.\n- If you\u2019re allergic to some of these ingredients, leave them out and search for a substitute with similar properties.\n- Lemongrass oil, Sage oil and Peppermint oil shouln\u2019t be used when pregnant or lactating.

It will receive funding for its hospitals, the prevention and control of other infectious diseases, emergency preparedness and response, and a boost in its quick response fund.\n\nThe Senate also wants unutilized or unreleased special purpose funds to be rechanneled to be used in the government\u2019s fight against COVID-19.\n\nSenator Pia Cayetano, who sponsored the measure, said funds from these sources will be used to distribute P5,000 to P8,000 a month to some 18 million families, which will amount to roughly P200 billion in two months.\n\n\u201cThe cost is clearly significant but we have the cash available.

It is far worse than the media are telling you.  \n I am a Chinese citizen in Wuhan who occupies \u2014 or   perhaps occupied \u2014 a high-ranking position in military intelligence. I  am also a member of the Chinese Communist Party. As a senior official near the top of the Party, I have access to a great deal of classified  information and I have been involved in many top-secret government  projects. I have a doctorate from a leading university in a western country, which is why I am able to write my account in English.\n\nI  have information that I believe could lead to the overthrow of my government. It is also relevant to billions of people outside of China,  all of whom are now in existential peril.\n\nIt will not surprise  you to hear that if my identity were to be revealed, my life would be in  grave danger, as would those of my wife and son. I ask you to respect the fact that I have stripped out of this account all facts that would  make it easy to identify me.\n\nBy now you will be familiar with the  recent outbreak of 2019-nCoV, also known as NCP, or simply  \"coronavirus\". You will have heard that it originated in Wuhan, an  industrial city in China, and that it came from an animal \u2014 most likely a  bat or a pangolin \u2014 that was sold in a wild animal market. You will  have been told that it is an influenza-like illness that can in severe  cases cause pneumonia, respiratory failure and death. Finally, you may  have heard that although the disease is highly infectious, it is  dangerous only to the elderly or to those who have a compromised immune  system. The official lethality rate is approximately 2% or so.\n\n All of that is a bunch of lies concocted by the Chinese state with the  tacit support of the U.S. deep state and its friends in the European  Union, Russia and Australia, and spread by the docile media in all of  those countries.\n\nLet me start by telling you that the world does  not operate the way you think it does. Although countries like the US  and China vie for global dominance, that competition is restricted to  certain limited areas. In most ways, the two countries are more  interested in cooperation so that they can stop other competing  countries from gaining more power. They also have a shared interest in  keeping real power out of the hands of their \"ordinary\" citizens. To  this end, they have many different mechanisms by which they control the  overwhelming majority of their media outlets. The Americans in  particular have perfected the art of creating made-up \"divisions\"  between their two main parties which are designed to hide the fact that  both serve the same masters.\n\nThese same nations also posses  technology that is far more advanced than you can imagine and which is  kept carefully hidden from public view. This includes advanced  artificial intelligence capable of undermining and deciding any election  in the world; biological and chemical agents that can manipulate and  control the thinking patterns and behaviours of citizens to terrifying  degrees; highly sophisticated manipulation techniques using hypnotic  practices entirely unknown to the public; and other things that I will  not go into now. My point is that the great nations do not compete so  much as work together. Their principal goal is to shield the true  workings of the world from the \"uninitiated\" public.\n\nJust to give  you one example, there aren\u2019t actually any nuclear weapons anywhere in  the world. The U.S. and the Soviet Union scrapped them all in the 1970s,  as did their client states. Everyone realised that those weapons could  not be used without destroying the whole world, so there was no need for  them; but by pretending that they still had them, the big players were  able to keep the non-nuclear powers in line.\n\nLet me return to the virus.", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1583454749, "author": "Garfield1415", "link_id": "t3_fe5144", "parent_id": "t3_fe5144", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": true, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": true, "sadness": false, "surprise": true, "trust": true, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fj841ov": {"body": "rump is pushing a dangerous, false spin on coronavirus \u2014 and the media is helping him spread it\n\nPresident Donald J.

But now as a deadly disease, the coronavirus, threatens to turn into a full-blown pandemic, it\u2019s not simply bizarre in a way that can be easily shrugged off. It\u2019s not just Trump being Trump.\nAD\nKeep Reading\n\nAnd it\u2019s definitely not funny. It\u2019s dangerous.\nCoronavirus: live updates, latest news\n\nTrump and his chosen spokespeople are attempting to dramatically play down the seriousness of the coronavirus and to blame the legitimate news media for doing their jobs of informing the public.\nAs Democrats slam Trump over coronavirus, Pence and Azar go on the defense\n\nVice President Pence and the HHS secretary panned criticism of the Trump administration's actions on the coronavirus March 1, but warned it will keep spreading. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\nIn reporting what Trump has to say, the news media has a huge responsibility not to repeat and amplify his misleading spin \u2014 a spin that may serve his political interests but is not in the public interest.\nIt\u2019s not always easy, though, for mainstream journalists to put his claims in the proper context.\nAfter all, it had always been normal to let a president have his say \u2014 to let his statements top the news while letting the fact checks follow.\nAD\n\nThat has changed somewhat during the lie-ridden Trump administration, but not nearly enough. The reflexive media urge, deep in our DNA, is still to quote the president without offering an immediate challenge.\nThat\u2019s why we continue to see headlines and chyrons that parrot his words directly, no matter how misleading: That the virus will disappear, that it\u2019s not inevitable that the disease will spread, that a vaccine is coming along \u201crapidly,\u201d that the United States is \u201cvery, very ready\u201d to deal with whatever happens.\nHow chyrons took on a life of their own in the Trump era\n\nWhen journalists do push back with fact checks or with dissenting sources from the worlds of science and medicine, Trump and the administration attack the messengers. Sometimes that takes the form of disparaging tweets such as one from Wednesday in which he charged cable networks MSNBC and CNN of \u201cpanicking markets\u201d and in which he bragged \u201cUSA in great shape!\u201d\nReporters yell questions as President Donald J.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\nHis most dependable allies are right there with him \u2014 accusing the mainstream news media of using virus coverage to try to take down the president.\nAD\n\nTheir logic seems to be that the drastic stock market declines in recent days are the result of media overkill, not legitimate business concerns. \u201cWhat I might do to calm the markets is turn the television off for 24 hours,\u201d was acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s advice Friday to the audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference.\nConservative pundits blame a grab bag of supposed villains amid the coronavirus outbreak\n\nSome months ago, I wrote about the linguist George Lakoff\u2019s prescription for handling the president\u2019s false statements and lies, an approach that\u2019s become known as the \u201ctruth sandwich.\u201d\nRather than lead with the falsehood and then try to debunk it, Lakoff \u2014 an expert on how propaganda works \u2014 suggested flipping that formula: Lead with the truth, air the falsehood, and then follow with the fact check.\nAD\n\nAvoid giving prominence to lies, he advises. Don\u2019t put them in headlines, leads or tweets. It is that very amplification that gives them power, even if they are proclaimed false in the next beat.\nOf course, that recommendation runs in direct opposition to how news usually works. Traditionally, we have emphasized the words of top officials, and only then tempered them with fact checks.\nWhat you need to know about coronavirus: Symptoms, risks, how to prepare\n\nToo often, Lakoff told me, the media \u201chas become complicit with Trump by allowing itself to be used as an amplifier for his falsehoods and frames.\u201d And that\u2019s true even when journalists make lists of lies. It\u2019s the repetition and the prominence that does the harm.\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s tendency to spin out assertions untethered from reality becomes a recipe for disaster when combined with his disdain for scientists, medical experts, intelligence officials, journalists and others who deal in fact-based reality.\nAdd in the dangers of a disease rapidly approaching pandemic proportions, and it becomes more important than ever to emphasize truthful information over false spin.\nI\u2019m convinced that we in the media, with all our obvious faults, have learned some things about covering Trump over the past four years.

Most of Trump's terrible decisions and completely inept people he's put into positions of power, simply because they were fawning sycophants who praised Trump whenever they could, haven't impacted most people.\n\nThe economy has mostly been doing okay, not because of anything Trump did, but he hasn't screwed it up.

Things could be better in many aspects, but for most people things aren't remarkably worse than they were under Obama.

It's easy to diffuse a situation that you created, dealing with one you didn't make takes actual good governance and leadership, which this administration lacks.\n\nSo, the inadequacies of this administration are now on full display. This is a situation Trump can't call a hoax or lie about and make up a funny name for it on twitter and it will go away. His need to talk things up and make things seem better than they are is sending mixed messages and creating uncertainty. Uncertainty creates a lot of apprehension, and that makes things even worse. Now, the failings of the administration are apparent to everyone and affecting the average person's life. Can I still travel? Can I still go to work? Can my kids still go to school?

By allowing psychologists with poor backgrounds on the subject authority over legal gatekeeping, - a result of the \"wild west\"-style culture of transgender healthcare that emerged due to demand appearing at a rate that outpaced education - trans people were placed in the absurd position of having to appease these standards in order to obtain the legal recognition needed to live an ordinary life.\n\nFor example, when I transitioned as a teenager, among the things I was criticized for when pursuing a gender dysphoria diagnosis partially under the NHS, which again is the first thing you need to achieve legal recognition of any sort under the current system, were: not having learned makeup good enough, not wearing a skirt, not speaking with a sufficiently feminine affect, not displaying enough overt enthusiasm about having developed breasts, not \"smiling enough\", not having a nice enough haircut, not having animated enough mannerisms, not having been penetrated in anal sex, not going a sufficient amount of time without masturbating, not desiring children, not being unambiguously attracted to men, and not consuming enough feminine-targeted media. \n\nWith the NHS showing very slow progress to improve in this respect and also being underfunded to the point that seeing a professional about gender dysphoria at all can now take up to 5 years (and because the presence of the NHS and the effect it has on the country's medical standards strangling most private alternatives that exist in places like the US), it is not surprising that many people sought a solution to legal recognition that divorced the process from psychological evaluation.\n\nI would speculate the Tories embraced this option because it allowed them to appear to be improving trans peoples lot without spending any money fixing these fundamental problems. That they are now abandoning this with their recent populist bent is disappointing, but only insofar as it is disappointing to go from being served a lousy meal at a restaurant to being served no meal at all.\n\nWhile obviously resources at present should be devoted to the coronavirus crisis, if in the long run the policy is abandoned without any substantial change away to repair the broken system that currently exists instead, then I expect rates of trans self-harm, suicide, and harm by misdiagnosis to only increase through the next decade in this country.", "subreddit": "ukpolitics", "created_utc": 1584790667, "author": "opaldrop", "link_id": "t3_fmc802", "parent_id": "t3_fmc802", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": true, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fjxf5wf": {"body": "No, that is not correct. Allow me to explain. \n\nAs you probably know, viruses can use either DNA or RNA as the alphabet in which they encode their genes - the whole of the genetic material is known as a genome. When viruses replicate, they also have to \"make copies\" of their genome. Coronaviruses use RNA. It's a well known fact that RNA viruses are genomically instable, meaning that their \"copying machines\" (enzymes known as RNA-dependant RNA-polymerase or RdRp) make frequent errors. Think of it as miss-spelling when you type at a keyboard. Each genetically different group of viruses is known as a genotype. There are already dozens of SARS-COV-2 genotypes around. Is this a problem? Let's see.\n\nThe immune system \"recognizes\" and attacks certain molecules, or fragment of molecules. These are known as antigens. But, what is the relationship between genotypes and antigens? Does a slightly different genotype necessarily lead to new antigens, that the immune system will not recognize anymore? Not at all. In fact, we must introduce the concept of SEROTYPE. A serotype is a strain of a pathogen that has different antigens. So, while there might be countless genotypes for RNA viruses, usually there is only one or a handful of serotypes. This is because our marvelous immune system will still recognize antigens even if they are a little bit different. \n\nAre there exceptions to this rule? Yes, there are. Some viruses are so variable, their copying machines are so faulty, that they can produce new serotypes more frequently than others. How frequently? Influenzaviruses produce new serotypes each year, around the world, hence having to cover for new, emerging serotypes with a yearly different vaccine. Then there are viruses like HIV or HCV whose copying machines are so unreliable, that they produce hundreds of different serotypes each day in each infected person. That is a primary reason why the immune system doesn't manage to get rid of them.\n\nWhat about the common cold? The common cold can be caused by hundreds of different viruses, however the four common cold-causing Coronaviruses are actually quite stable. Coronaviruses on the whole are among the most stable RNA viruses. The reason why you can get reinfected multiple times is because of a different phenomenon, known as immunological amnesia. What this means is that after a little while your immune system simply forgets about these viruses. The reason is currently unknown, but it is suspected to be because they cause so little damage in such a localized area that a weak immune response is mounted, insufficient to evoke long-term immunity. \n\nWhat about COVID-19? We don't know. We don't know how long immunity would last. It has to be said, however, that in SARS, which was caused by a very similar virus, antibodies persisted for up to 3 years (but were faded by 6 years) while another kind of immunity (T-cell based immunity) was detectable 11 years after the disease. Authors argued that this would have been enough to prevent reinfection. We don't know if the same will be applicable to COVID-19, but they do are very similar.\n\n [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26954467](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26954467) \n\nSo, to sum it up: no, SARS-COV-2 is not \"ever-changing\" and this poses no problem to a possible vaccine. The real question is what to do if natural immunity is short-lived and we don't manage to obtain longer lenghts with vaccines: the answer is most likely boosters, i.e. periodically repeating vaccines. But there is no indication that we'd need to adjust the vaccine or anything like that. RNA viruses like polio or measles have been around for literally decades, circulating in hundreds of millions of people and accumulating innumerable mutations, but vaccines still work perfectly fine on them. Only influenza really needs adjustments. \n\nI hope I have cleared this up for you!", "subreddit": "COVID19", "created_utc": 1583670958, "author": "TruthfulDolphin", "link_id": "t3_ffb15o", "parent_id": "t3_ffb15o", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": true, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fjwbsv5": {"body": "It's not about thinking, it's fact. It's how these things work. It's not complicated to understand. A virus is much like a wildfire. If you protect an area and shut down the fire and then do not prevent the fire from getting back it will come back if it's raging everyone else... or if you actually don't contain it and eliminate it then it will flair up again.\n\nThe only difference is that with the virus is that it won't kill 100%, unlike a fire which, if it burns the material it will generally do so to completion. It is actually worse than a fire.\n\nImagine a huge forest fire where the same material could be re-burned many times. Now, if immunity develops with the virus it will be like this but then one has to deal with mutations.\n\nSo, we will definitely see a huge increase and essentially it will be like wuhan 1.0.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn mathematics(or science in general) these are independent events. The virus doesn't know or care how many it as infected. It is called a memory-less process. \n\nSo all it will take is ONE person infected to ignite the fire again. Now, again, it's not 100% because there are many factors involved. Immunity, vaccines(not yet), awareness, drugs that help, etc...\n\nThere is about a 99% chance that we will see them reinfected, assuming they will report it. The slave masters, though, do not care about the slaves... just the $$$.  They want to get people back to work ASAP. At most some will die and many will get sick but they will recover, but there will be at least some people working. That is how most western governments are approaching it to avoid the economic damage. They will accept some dead, as long as many are working they are ok with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example, you can quarantine 100% of the population for 6months and have 0% economic progress(this could be a major logistics problem but governments are suppose to have prepared for such events). Essentially push the hold button and go in to maximal shutdown to preserve society(take the economic hit but save many).\n\nOr you can ignore the problem 100%. What happens is some people will become sick, say 20%, some will die, say 5%. But you still have 75% of the population working which will eventually increase back to 95%... still making that $$$. The governments and corps could give a rats ass about the dead. Hell, they might give a check to the families to make them shut up(which the families end up having to work extra to pay back(nice trick)). They might say \"We will \"absorb\" the cost of the burials and give you 1k$ for any \"inconvenience\" and then you will see taxes slowly increase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, this also has many factors. If one can be reinfected then the death rate will clime to 100% over time. If the death rate is 10% and the sick cannot return to work then you lost 30% of the workforce. If there are multiple strains then you won't be able to stop people from getting sick and the death rate will climb to 100%.

(This has happened *provably* for H1N1 flu, has also shown strong evidence of happening for multiple other diseases including measles, and there's strong evidence this has occurred in past with human coronaviruses. \n\nb) Burn out because it runs out of hosts, quite possibly because it's TOO good at killing its hosts or it fails to propagate.  (Ebola--though it's showing trends at \"taming down\"; Sin Nombre hantavirus; the Black Death; whatever caused the Plague of Athens historically that Thuciclydes described, whether it was filoviral or possibly some other disease; the Picardy Sweat; many other diseases historically).\n\nEven smallpox seems to have calmed down over time ([variola minor or alastrim becoming the dominant form of smallpox in the US and Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastrim) in the earliest 20th Century and eventually becoming the last form of smallpox in the wild before it was wiped out in the mid-seventies--it's actually theorized alastrim NOT killing most of its patients (around a \"bad flu year\" 2% death rate versus the usual 20-30% for variola major in non-naive populations and closer to 60-90% mortality in naive populations) gave it a significant survival advantage).\n\nI seriously, SERIOUSLY doubt that somehow COVID-19 is going to be the Grand Exception to a trend that has occurred with human viruses (and for that matter, human infectious diseases in general) of remaining both \"super-infectious and super-deadly\".  If (or more properly, the odds are likely to be *when*, not if--but we'll be diplomatic and say \"if\") a mutation occurs that makes COVID-19 less likely to throw someone into full-blown pneumonia but still allows it to survive (and in fact may make it more transmissible, because people won't be pretty much ready to go into the hospital)...THAT variation is likely to have a survival advantage, simply because people will treat it more like a bad chest cold than SARS 2.0.  This is simple, pure Occam's Razor here.\n\nViruses that kill people tend to be very aggressively treated by humans and quarantined and treated as Bad Things, which (even aside from the fact that a virus can't reproduce well in a host if it kills the host in the process) does not exactly help the long-term survival of the virus as a disease.  \n\n(Put more bluntly: People passed alastrim more than \"classical smallpox\" in the early 20th century because alastrim typically didn't have close to a 1 in 3 chance of killing you and had milder symptoms--you didn't go into the classical \"pocks\" as much, you were still well enough to move around and do things.  Smallpox, pretty much health departments were shutting down apartment buildings just like the Chinese government does with COVID-19 (and people *were* all but welded into their houses--more commonly, kept in their houses or sent to sanatoria by literal gunpoint if necessary) and doing mass ring immunization (again, occasionally by literal gunpoint) when smallpox was found--there was a distinct advantage for a Subtler Smallpox, even in crowded cities.)\n\nYou see, I'm *not* just counting the effects of \"random mutation in X population\" and \"does a milder virus have an easier time spreading in Chennai\"--public health measures *in and of themselves* actually have to be considered as part of the natural history of an emerging infectious disease, and in cases where pretty much anyone showing obvious symptoms of \"classical COVID-19\" is likely to be subjected to quarantine...simple evolution *will* in time favour a \"COVID-19 descendant\" that is better adapted to the human body and less likely to throw one into the hospital, or the disease will *in time* burn itself out, either via running out of hosts (because everyone is immune and/or it's killed everyone potentially infectable) or running out of hosts (in that effective antivirals, prophylactics, and vaccines are widely available and pretty much Science The Fuck out of the existence of the disease).\n\n(And honestly, the former scenario...COVID-19 eventually getting into ENOUGH of a symbiosis with humans over time that eventually humans will be immune enough--and the virus having acquired enough \"survive in humans without killing them\" beneficial mutations...is the most likely.  I won't lie in that the \"adaptation period\" is probably Not Going To Be Fun, but it's certainly NOT going to be a literal \"28 Days After\"/\"I Am Legend\"/\"The Stand\" type of Infectious Disease Apocalypse that wipes out most of humanity and throws us back to the Early Medieval Period. It's also unlikely at this point that it's going to completely burn itself out or be stamped out before it has the chance to evolve (thanks, PRC government :/). It's almost certainly NOT going to remain \"infectious or deadly\", though; the history of infectious diseases as long as humans have been documenting them show one or the other ultimately will give.)\n\nI am also patiently (and without personal attacks, unlike yourself) asking again for your hypothesis on why H1N1 flus in humans and swine (both of which actually are traceable genetically and epidemiologically to the original late 1910s \"Spanish Flu\", a novel H1N1 influenza virus) are significantly less severe in their effects than the H1N1 flu from the late 1910s through at least the 1930s, despite world events (including World War II; the rise of megacities; mass human refugee crises; Europe having concentration camps that were literally breeding disease and the Soviet Union having gulags that were also plague factories because of the horrible conditions wherein; the rise of world travel, particularly travel by air and car; and the human population increasing by sixfold in general and reaching well over a billion people in China and India alone) that--by your stated hypothesis that diseases do not necessarily \"tame down\" in crowded conditions--should have resulted in preservation of something related to wild-type H1N1 (1918 serotype) that had equivalent morbidity and mortality to the original \"Spanish Flu\" serotypes.\n\n(Again, not being facetious.  I'd honestly like to hear your explanation as to why people were not dropping dead en masse during World War II from the Spanish Flu 2.0.  Or why Vietnamese refugee camps weren't having 1918-esque morbidity and mortality rates.  Or why China didn't see similar rates, and why Woodstock wasn't the epicentre of an H1N1 pandemic of similar severity to the \"Spanish Flu\".  No matter what your theory is, I'm curious as to your explanation as to why we're not seeing Spanish Flu now, even in the more distinctly crowded parts of the world.)\n\n(I'm also curious as to your explanation as to why there are definite changes in genetic markers in modern H1N1 flus versus H1N1(1918) specifically associated with morbidity and mortality--especially increased triggering of cytokine floods and *possibly* some neurological effects with H1N1(1918) versus modern H1N1 flus.  But first, I'm interested in your theory as to why we don't have a reservoir of the old-style \"infectious and deadly\" H1N1 flu a la WW I and mostly have to worry about \"swine flus\" descended from it.)", "subreddit": "COVID19", "created_utc": 1582334761, "author": "kusuriurikun", "link_id": "t3_f750k5", "parent_id": "t1_fibukxm", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": true, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": true, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": true, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fgh79rq": {"body": "&gt; # NUS, NTU students deliver meals to uni mates on leave of absence\n\n&gt; Students at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) have started making daily food deliveries to their university mates at student lodgings who have been placed on a 14-day leave of absence due to recent travel to China.\n\n&gt; The leave of absence - previously announced as part of measures to protect schools from the new coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan - is precautionary, while a quarantine order is much more stringent and has legal force with severe penalties for non-compliance.\n\n&gt; The universities' food delivery initiative was lauded by National Development Minister Lawrence Wong in his ministerial statement in Parliament yesterday.\n\n&gt; \"This is the Singapore Spirit which will enable us to prevail against the virus,\" said Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force tackling the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n&gt; The number of university students who are on leave of absence had not been released at press time.\n\n&gt; At Cinnamon College, the University Scholars Programme (USP) residential college, a group of 18 undergraduates have taken up food delivery duties since Monday last week.\n\n&gt; NUS has four other residential colleges, seven student halls of residences and two student residences.

I agree that they've been through SARS, so they should be hyper aware. For that the Chinese government is definitely in the wrong. There is no doubt about that.\n\nHowever, SARS' infection rate was significantly lower than COVID-19. Not only was SARS harder to contract, it was also not contagious during the incubation period from what I understand. Therefore, my comment on not knowing it'll be this bad still stands.\n\nTaiwan did a remarkable job in containing COVID-19 so far, and definitely should be commended for it. That is absolutely correct. Macau also recorded only 10 cases and had no new cases since early February, and that was without boarder closures (they are directly connected to Mainland China), although they did close all casinos. However, Taiwan's (and Singapore, Macau, etc) success should be compared to other countries. With China, it's not necessarily a fair comparison. Taiwan had more time to react.\n\nNo matter which country a disease initiated in, there had to be a period of time for the medical professionals and government to first form an opinion on the disease, then to figure out what level of action they need to take. Unfortunately, every disease is a little different, especially ones we have not seen before. Just like SARS is different from MERS and both are different from COVID-19.\n\nFor example, MERS, with its lower infection rate may not warrant the closure of cities and boarders even though the mortality rate is much higher.\n\nTaiwan, and other places, if faced with being the initial country would also had to have taken the time to verify the issue before they could react while people keep getting infected at the epic center. And with world travel, it can still spread very quickly.\n\nTherefore, comparing a non-patient-zero country to a patient-zero country is kind of like comparing apples and oranges. But again, I'm not saying things couldn't have been done a lot better in China in terms of taking it more seriously much earlier. But for a fair comparison we should be looking at Taiwan, Singapore and Macau vs Italy, UK, USA and Canada, for example.\n\nI don't agree when you said \"it would be right if it happened in European countries\" though. SARS was widely known in terms of it's effects, so even those who did not experience it first hand should have the same alertness to it. Of course, that is unless they somehow thinks they are superior in some way and are not susceptible to \"Asian\" disease or some crazy non-sense.\n\nYou criticized China as being an authoritarian country and seem to believe this whole thing was due to her being one. However, considering the lack of response and planning of the many democratic countries like Italy, UK, the rest of EU, US and Canada, even when they had so much time to observe the entire thing go down in China, I highly doubt these countries would have done a very good job if in China's shoes.\n\nI mean, even now our Canadian government is still telling us the risk is low and only CONSIDERING not letting certain high risk people in our country. And all that is after our stupid PM's wife caught the virus in UK.\n\nIf all of these non-authoritarian countries would have closed their boarders as soon as China decided to close off Wuhan, we may be all like Taiwan now, contained and happy. We'd only be dealing with stray cases of COVID-19 carriers who left China before the boarder closures. But no, they decided it was nothing. They decided the risk was low. They decided to put politics and the economy in front of the well-being of their citizens.\n\nThe issue may have started in China and their authoritarian government may have made bad choices, but the non-authoritarian countries had made horrible and even worse choices too before we get to where we are now.\n\nSure, one may say, \"oh, but the CCP pressured the WHO... Blah blah blah...\" We don't have evidence of that, but even if we do, it takes some ridiculous stupidity for these non-authoritarian countries to believe in this so called CCP-controlled-WHO that things are ok. It takes some serious negligence for these non-authoritarian countries to continue to treat it as low risk when China's action since the closure of Wuhan clearly says otherwise.\n\nThis whole ordeal has nothing to do with authoritarian vs democratic/non-authoritarian rule. It has to do with our governments (exclude Taiwan, Singapore and Macau) being incompetent, ignorant and arrogant. And unfortunately, this pandemic proved that stupidity in governments does not discriminate between the type of rule. Although so far, I see more inaction from democratic countries even after sufficient information was provided. (And if we don't believe in China's data, then the more we should have treated this seriously!)\n\nThe fact that we are dealing with a pandemic today is something EVERY GOVERNMENT (except Taiwan, Singapore and Macau) is to be blamed. China made some wrong moves initially, but it's the other countries' inaction that made it so much worse.\n\nSo, sure, keep yelling at CCP and be blind to the worse shortcomings of our own governments.", "subreddit": "China_Flu", "created_utc": 1584222917, "author": "kooritsuki", "link_id": "t3_fiiiu4", "parent_id": "t1_fkif37h", "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": false, "disgust": true, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": true, "pessimism": true, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": true, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fkxd1zp": {"body": "Hello Mr. Gates,\n\nI'm an Italian economist.\nIt seems like the world is lacking of a \"collective intelligence\" to deal with important issues like climate change and pandemics that, once solved, the entire world will benefit due to their win-win solution hence why I rely on you as the only leader to move these things ahead.\n2 questions related to coronavirus:\n\n1.

The plan of the Civil Protection for the containment of the Coronavirus is operational. It provides for different intervention scenarios including the handling of eventual emergencies on ships, in order to avoid a repeat of what happend in Japan with thousand of people stuck on board [of the Diamond Princess cruise ship]. And it excludes the possible requisition of private properties or hotels, like it instead happens in case of natural calamities.\n\nFacemasks for the Regions where the outbreaks are located.\n\nIn these past few day more than once it has been asked to supply [face]masks, in particular the ones with a filter, in order to \u201cisolate\u201d the positives and to limit the spread of the contagion.

If the sanitary situation were to further deteriorate and if there will be a lack of beds for the sick, then every Region has chosen an hospital that would be emptied of other patients in order to let in only those who have caught the virus.\n\nAvoiding the spread in the ports.\n\nThe goal now is to avoid as much as possible the spread of the contagion, as well as panic. Thus every possible emergency scenario has been planned out. Amongst these there is the possible spread of the desease on a cruise ship. In order to avoid that all the tourists were forced to stay onboard with a high risk of getting sick, a series of ports that have the adequate structures to handle the recption and sorting of the passengers have been selected: [these ports are] Civitavecchia, Bari, Ancona and Ravenna. The procedure forsees that the passengers will undergo triage before landing and then they will be divided between asymptomatics headed for the barracks and symptomatics to instead be transferred to the hospitals. The families will not be split and foreign passengers will be immediatly be sent to their home country.\n\nFirst published by Corriere della Sera 02/03/2020, manually translated by u/minos83 04/03/2020.", "subreddit": "europe", "created_utc": 1583305512, "author": "minos83", "link_id": "t3_fd9b8c", "parent_id": "t3_fd9b8c", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": true}, "complete": false}, "fib1wg0": {"body": "Dominic Cummings has had a bad few weeks. After advertising for \u201cweirdos and misfits\u201d to shake up Downing Street, the first weirdo employed \u2014 a \u201csuperforecaster\u201d \u2014 proved a bit too weird.\n\nThere had been his comments about race and IQ, preventing an \u201cunderclass\u201d through mass contraception and \u2014 as journalists trawled deeper into Andrew Sabisky\u2019s internet history \u2014 the brief foray into sex advice centred on the virtues of submissive wives.\n\nAnd now, following the young special adviser\u2019s inevitable resignation, reporters were at Mr Cummings\u2019s house asking him about his employment policy. Was it all going well? His response? \u201cRead Philip Tetlock's *Superforecasters*, instead of political pundits who don't know what they're talking about.\u201d\n\nA few days and hundreds of inquiries later and Tetlock, a Canadian academic, has been forced to draft a standard response to copy and paste into emails to journalist.\n\nHe is happy about the attention, and pleased people are interested in his work, but \u201cit would be unfortunate\u201d, he wrote, \u201cif superforecasting came to be linked in the public mind with a political point of view\u201d..\n\nIndeed his life\u2019s work, the promotion of a method for making better political and geopolitical forecasts, is ideology neutral \u2014 and, he says, definitely not to be associated with race science. \u201cContrary to recent rumours in UK,\u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019s no sinister Nietzschean *\u00dcbermenschen* agenda.\u201d\n\nIt has been, then, a busy week for Tetlock \u2014 not to mention a fraught one, as is any week in which you are forced to distance yourself from belief in a master race. Although, he says speaking to *The Times,* he was not as surprised as you might think to find himself invoked on the Islington doorstep of a Downing Street overlord.\n\nIn fact, he says, this is not even the first time a government official has referenced his research. Remember when Michael Gove said that \u201cpeople in this country have had enough of experts\u201d? That, he thinks, was him too.\n\nTetlock is best known for one fact. Over a decade ago he analysed 30,000 predictions made by hundreds of experts from television, print and radio \u2014 the \u201cpundits\u201d Cummings was referring to. His conclusion? Their accuracy is, quite literally, \u201cno better than a chimp with a dartboard\u201d.\n\nWorse, the more eminent the expert the worse their results. The people we rely on to make predictions about the future are, in general, very bad at it indeed.\n\nTetlock is not only familiar with the case of Mr Sabisky. He is arguably the reason he was employed at all. Because if the first half of Tetlock\u2019s career was about showing how bad most predictions are, the second was about making them better. Sabisky is the product of that and \u2014 forays into eugenics aside \u2014 Tetlock thinks Downing Street needs more people like him, rather than fewer.\n\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re Tory or Labour, whether you\u2019re Democrat or Republican, whatever your party affiliation and whatever modern democracy we\u2019re talking about,\u201d he says, \u201cyou should prefer that leaders are receiving predictions that are as accurate as possible.\u201d\n\nTo do so, he argues, you need to employ the services \u2014 and methods \u2014 of superforecasters.\n\nA \u201csuperforecaster\u201d is not a title people give themselves. It is, like the science that created it, a precisely-defined concept. After learning that most experts are bad at predictions, Tetlock went on a hunt to find those who aren\u2019t. Working with the US intelligence services, a series of global tournaments was launched, in which people \u2014 experts, pundits, schoolteachers, binmen \u2014 made predictions.\n\nThey answered questions including: \u201cWill there be a London Bridge-scale terror attack in a European capital city in the next three months?\u201d and \u201cHow many total cases of Wuhan coronavirus will have been reported by the World Health Organisation as of 20 March 2020?\u201d\n\nThese are precise questions, to which clear answers are required. They are not afflicted by the curse of prediction that Tetlock identifies as \u201cvague verbiage forecasting\u201d, where assessments come in a form where it would be \u201cvery difficult after the outcome is known to assess who is closer to be right\u201d.\n\nWhen an expert, for instance, says Britain is going to \u201cget Brexit done, and make a success of it\u201d, it is difficult to see \u2014 barring utter catastrophe or an unprecedented boom \u2014 how the word \u201csuccess\u201d can ever be contradicted or affirmed. This kind of statement is perhaps defensible in politics. It should not be so, argues Tetlock, in political or intelligence advice.\n\n\u201cYou have experts making claims along the lines of, \u2018there's a distinct possibility that the Iranian nuclear programme will successfully produce an atomic bomb by the end of 2021\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat does \u2018distinct possibility\u2019 mean in that context? It could mean anything between roughly 20 to 80 per cent, depending on whether you're focused on \u2018distinct\u2019 or \u2018possibility\u2019.\u201d\n\nThis matters. \u201cThe semantic elasticity of the forecast protects the forecaster from falsification, and that slows down the learning process and makes it much harder, for both experts and the people who consume expertise, to evaluate who was closer to the truth on what.\u201d\n\nWorse, he suspects the sensible analyst might even deliberately skew their answers. \u201cAs a reasonably career-savvy analyst there are two mistakes here. You could underestimate the likelihood of getting a bomb or overestimate.\u201d\n\nYou could be wrong, in other words, because Tel Aviv gets nuked and you thought it wouldn\u2019t, or wrong because nothing happens and you suggested it might. \u201cWhich mistake would be worse for my career? That is the calculus that goes on inside every organisation all the time and that's a problem with the traditional civil service model.\u201d\n\nIn the forecasting tournaments, that is not possible. When people make an assessment, they have to put a number to it. Then, their accuracy is judged. And when it was, of all the thousands of entrants, Sabisky fell in the top 2 per cent and within a category termed \u201csuperforecasters\u201d. Then, he was employed by Mr Cummings to advise on defence, on questions such as whether Iran would get a bomb.\n\nSuperforecasters are all different, but they also share traits. To do well in the tournaments you can have an ideology but Tetlock, who works at the University of Pennsylvania, has found you must put it aside when assessing facts. You must be aware of, and avoid, common cognitive biases.\n\nFor instance, in the wake of a London Bridge terror attack you might guess a higher chance of another happening. A superforecaster would instead look at the base frequency of terror attacks going back five years and start with that. Then by reading around the subject, but not too much \u2014 most are at the level of \u201cinformed *New York Times* readers\u201d \u2014 he or she would come up with a probability figure.\n\nThese are, says Tetlock, exactly the qualities needed in Downing Street. \u201cThe UK is in an interesting situation, post Brexit. There's a lot of pressure on the leadership to be resourceful. So I think it's understandable they should want to look to improve the quality of the decision-making process. I can't help but admire government officials who show an interest in rethinking how probability estimates flow into the policy process.\u201d\n\nEventually, he says, this idea of using probabilities and keeping score will not seem niche nor even controversial \u2014 but obvious. Then, a century or so in the future, with the \u201ccrushing condescension of history\u201d we will look back on the way we made decisions in 2020 with the scorn we reserve today for the Salem witch trials.\n\nSo, in the main, he is pleased that earlier this week the government\u2019s chief adviser took time out while stepping past his wheelie bin to recommend his book. Although he adds, given what prompted it: \u201cI would probably have rathered I had come up in a different context.\u201d", "subreddit": "ukpolitics", "created_utc": 1582312929, "author": "Fra_Bernardo", "link_id": "t3_f7g3pv", "parent_id": "t3_f7g3pv", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": true, "fear": true, "joy": true, "love": false, "optimism": true, "pessimism": true, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": true, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fkdk1r0": {"body": "Mikel Arteta testing positive is an example of how events force actions relatively rapidly.  \n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/12/premier-league-plays-on-as-normal-while-other-top-leagues-cancel\n\n&gt; Premier League clubs are preparing for the football season to be suspended after the Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta tested positive for coronavirus on Thursday night and their match on Saturday against Brighton was postponed.\n\n&gt; Arsenal confirmed their first team squad and coaches would now self-isolate, and they would be unable to play some fixtures on the scheduled dates.

However, as in the case of 2019-nCoV, most types of coronaviruses primarily affect the respiratory system, which at critical times leads to the development of SARS, which in the absence of adequate and timely therapy can lead to death of the patient.\n\n## Diseases caused by coronaviruses\n\n**Diseases of the upper respiratory tract** \\- [acute respiratory infections](https://yandex.com/turbo?parent-reqid=1584067794292708-244623112302846481100079-sas4-3023&amp;utm_source=turbo_turbo&amp;text=https%3A//medicina.dobro-est.com/orz-simptomyi-prichinyi-vidyi-lechenie-i-profilaktika-orz.html) ( [pharyngitis](https://yandex.com/turbo?parent-reqid=1584067794292708-244623112302846481100079-sas4-3023&amp;utm_source=turbo_turbo&amp;text=https%3A//medicina.dobro-est.com/faringit-opisanie-vidyi-prichinyi-simptomyi-i-lechenie-faringita.html) , [sinusitis](https://yandex.com/turbo?parent-reqid=1584067794292708-244623112302846481100079-sas4-3023&amp;utm_source=turbo_turbo&amp;text=https%3A//medicina.dobro-est.com/sinusit-prichinyi-simptomyi-vidyi-i-lechenie-sinusita.html) , etc.), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

The culprits are - HCoV NL63, HCoV 229E.\n\nCoronavirus was first detected in relatively recent 1965, when examining a patient with signs of [acute respiratory viral infection (ARVI)](https://yandex.com/turbo?parent-reqid=1584067794292708-244623112302846481100079-sas4-3023&amp;utm_source=turbo_turbo&amp;text=https%3A//medicina.dobro-est.com/orvi-opisanie-simptomyi-prichinyi-lechenie-i-profilaktika-orvi.html) . Since that time, similar types of viruses have been identified that have been shown not only in humans but also in animals.\n\nThe course of acute respiratory viral infections caused by coronaviruses in the vast majority had a mild and moderate course and did not threaten the life of living organisms. But this was until 2002, when the world was alarmed by repeated deaths from complications of SARS. As it turned out, the causative agent was a new type of coronavirus - SARS (SARS-CoV, Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus). SARS-CoV provoked the development of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, SARS, purple death). Infection caused destruction of lung alveoli cells, which led to mortality in 9% with SARS.\n\nThe next step in the promotion of Coronaviridae was MERS (MERS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome), which causes Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), which also recorded many deaths.\n\nAnd so 2019\u20132020, COVID-19 was discovered, which at the beginning of the outbreak was called \u201c2019-nCoV,\u201d or the so-called Chinese coronavirus (Wuhan), from which as of 02/11/2020, 170 people have already died.\n\n**What is interesting about these three types of viruses?** All 3 were first recorded in China, bats and partially, snakes, are considered the reservoir of all three. It is these representatives of the animal world that calmly enter the diet of many residents of the East.\n\nT \n\n## Symptoms of Coronavirus\n\n[The incubation period of](https://yandex.com/turbo?parent-reqid=1584067794292708-244623112302846481100079-sas4-3023&amp;utm_source=turbo_turbo&amp;text=https%3A//medicina.dobro-est.com/inkubatsionnyiy-period-infektsii-i-bolezni.html) coronavirus is from 2 to 10 days, depending on the type and strain of infection.\n\nMost people become infected only with the first signs of the disease. However, according to various scientists and medical workers, the 2019-nCoV newly detected in China is distributed even during the incubation period, i.e. a person becomes contagious even before he has symptoms.\n\nIn addition, different types of coronavirus can cause different localization of the lesion - some are manifested mainly in the digestive tract, others in the respiratory system.\n\n### The first signs of coronavirus infection\n\n* The onset of the disease in most people is acute and manifests itself in the form of moderate [fever](https://yandex.com/turbo?parent-reqid=1584067794292708-244623112302846481100079-sas4-3023&amp;utm_source=turbo_turbo&amp;text=https%3A//medicina.dobro-est.com/lihoradka-prichinyi-simptomyi-i-lechenie.html) ;\n* Sore throat, coughing;\n* Itchy nose, [sneezing](https://yandex.com/turbo?parent-reqid=1584067794292708-244623112302846481100079-sas4-3023&amp;utm_source=turbo_turbo&amp;text=https%3A//medicina.dobro-est.com/chihane-prichinyi-simptomyi-lechenie.html) ;\n* [Headache](https://yandex.com/turbo?parent-reqid=1584067794292708-244623112302846481100079-sas4-3023&amp;utm_source=turbo_turbo&amp;text=https%3A//medicina.dobro-est.com/golovnaya-bol-prichinyi-i-snyatie-golovnoy-boli.html) and [muscle](https://yandex.com/turbo?parent-reqid=1584067794292708-244623112302846481100079-sas4-3023&amp;utm_source=turbo_turbo&amp;text=https%3A//medicina.dobro-est.com/bol-v-myishtsah-prichinyi-i-lechenie.html) pain.\n\n....", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1584068127, "author": "wadenelsonredditor", "link_id": "t3_fhsdp3", "parent_id": "t3_fhsdp3", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": true}, "complete": false}, "fg3ev48": {"body": "Stop fearmongering!!! \n\nYou don't even understand what you are sharing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Most of the infected patients were men (30 \\[73%\\] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 \\[32%\\]), including diabetes (eight \\[20%\\]), hypertension (six \\[15%\\]), and cardiovascular disease (six \\[15%\\]).

Once I realised it made me feel awful and I have with mixed results gone back several times to some of these people to apologise, say sorry  , try again or just yo yo until i end up blocking not always for good reasons.

I'm happy to say now i finally have omitted him from my life and all but see reality :)\n\nAfter that I went the opposite way..i dated my long term best friend online briefly, didnt sleep together its only ever been the narcissist whose had proper sex with me. its a significant detail. i turned my friend down too, i couldnt do it. Also he was total opposite im every way to the narcissist , looks , height, personality , intensity hence being my friend, i found it difficult to be attracted to him so im wondering if that is a deal breaker for me? he treated me much better than my ex and never would have abused me intentionally like he did. \nBut he had his own issues and kept saying he couldnt do it, could do it, couldnt, could on off until after i got home he talked himself until breaking up AGAIN so i said \"okay fine been nice knowing you\" i was still not completely over my ex at that point, yes i loved him my friend even tho i wasnt completely happy and i struggled with the attraction and us looking different. I'm slim n he was on the stocky side but..i dunno maybe he was TOO different to the ex to adjust, hes not someone i ever would have picked given a picture choice for instance. but maybe thats my ego talking? Im still not sure, but that was part of why i let him go and i thougjt it wouldnt be fair if he found me attractive and i didnt feel the same.\n\nSince then theres been very little activity on the dating front, i dont flirt , I dont online date, i dont sleep or hook up with people friends or otherwise . It was just too painful to even consider  As my mental health got so extreme i regularly had migraines, palpitations, ruminating episodes, anger, suicidal thoughts, upset and confusion, back and forth behaviour with people and exes. I've struggled emotionally since I was a child . Its been very hard and sometimes I thought i would just despair and die\n\nAnyway i'm doing a lot better now, I'm making a daily habit of self care, exercise , changing my thinkinghabits to not blow things out of control and makinc my friendships healthier and more balanced. I'm in therapy and actively working on myself and what my needs and wants are. It's a very slow work in progress but change is happening and I know that it all comes from me and I can't blame anybody else.\nI joined a chatroom and am making some great friends there and slowly opening up to guys alongside having balanced friendships with awesome and helpful people. both men and women. It's a huge learning curve for me for sure! I've never been this balanced and progressive in my entire life\nI'm just wondering what this means on the dating front because i already got talking to a handful of guys just to experiment, some are like no way, some i get reminded of my ex, some i question of my standards are too high, ie consider dating a non conventially atttractive person but then i still turn that around because of them as people not seeming right (this is teaching me what im.lookimg for and what im not!). I also still get triggered in varying degrees and im not sure how to handle that? \nI might not be ready still maybe im just learning about people and a balanced life in general.\nis there any hope for people who are so prone to these issues? a part of me is so scared i will be even loosely bound to my past forever and never fully get past the initial stages. People are so complicated! it can be hugely disappointing and exhausting\nGod knows how i even wanted to even open up my heart again but thats humans for you! \n\nSorry this was so long i just really wanted to vent before making mistake after mistake or some compromising situation falling for the wrong person\nI really do need some help I think\nthanks for reading and if anyone can help :)", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "created_utc": 1584979560, "author": "abz_msn", "link_id": "t3_fnmfzr", "parent_id": "t3_fnmfzr", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": true, "fear": true, "joy": true, "love": true, "optimism": true, "pessimism": true, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": true, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fiaao8h": {"body": " \n\nA second university is offering Chinese students a financial incentiv\u00ade to study this semester despite the coronavirus travel ban, as the federal government prepare\u00ads to ease the ban enough to allow some students to enter Australi\u00ada directly from China.\n\nOn Friday, the University of Adelaide emailed its 3000 or so Chinese students caught overseas by the ban offering a \u201ccare package\u201d worth about $5000 \u2014 a 20 per cent discount on first-\u00adsemester tuition fees plus airfare support of up to $2000, which they will be eligible for once the travel ban is lifted.\n\nActing on medical advice, the government is planning to allow about 1000 Chinese research stud\u00adents to enter directly from China in a week\u2019s time. After that it will consider allowin\u00adg other groups of Chinese students to fly directly to Australia, although it is not clear how the groups will be selected.\n\nThe plan to ease the ban is based on [expert advice ](https://www.health.gov.au/news/australian-health-protection-principal-committee-ahppc-recommendation-on-travel-restrictions-and-coronavirus-covid-19)to the government which said it can consider relaxing restrictions from February 29 if coronavirus case numbers in China, outside Hubei province, do not show a \u201cmaterial increase\u201d.\n\nThe government\u2019s official expert group, the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, also said that if epidemiological indicators remained as they were, the entry of Chinese students \u201cwould not materially increase the current low risk of importation of cases from mainland China (outside of Hubei province)\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, increasing numbers of Chinese students are beating the travel ban by travelling to third countries, where they must spend a 14-day quarantine period before entering Australia.\n\nBen, a student enrolled at RMIT who did not want to give his full name, said he planned to fly to Australia on February 23. He said he was not confident of getting in, \u201cbut I must take the risk\u201d.\n\nMelbourne education consultant Gary Li, who is in Bangkok to assist Chinese students transiting to Australia, said his students did not regret choosing the third-country option because they don\u2019t know how long the travel ban will be in force.\n\nThe Group of Eight univer\u00adsities, where most of the 100,000 Chinese students caught by the ban are enrolled, said it wanted its students back on campus as soon as possible. Go8 chief executive Vicki Thomson said the group appreciated and welcomed the government considering the medical advice. \u201cWe will explore all options to see what can be achieved with government support,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Ian Jacobs, vice-chancellor of Go8 university UNSW, warned against a \u201cpiecemeal relaxation\u201d of the travel ban. \u201cI\u2019m sure that any relaxation would be well-intentioned but it could end up causing confusion and even more anxiety, and be very difficult to imple\u00adment,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Australian Health Protection Principal Committee said in its advice to the government that students entering directly from China would \u201cneed to agree to self-isolation in Australia\u201d and universities would need to support that.\n\nThe committee is made up of the state and territory chief health officers and is chaired by Australia\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, Brendan Murphy. In its statement, the committee also revealed that the China travel ban could be relaxed for a small number of other cases, including Year 11 and 12 school stud\u00adents, as long as they were not from Hubei province.\n\nWestern Sydney University this week offered its stranded Chinese students $1500 towards the cost of beating the travel ban by transiting a third country but the University of Adelaide is not encouraging that option.\n\nBut it is offering each of its stranded Chinese students a personalised study plan and will allow them to study online until June 1, when they need to be on campus to complete first semester face-to-face. The university will give late-arriving Chinese students inten\u00adsive tutorials to help them complete their studies on time.", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1582297009, "author": "pooheygirl", "link_id": "t3_f7c693", "parent_id": "t3_f7c693", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": true, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": true, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fj9as9b": {"body": "University of Washington's statement to faculty is from the school of psychology. Can't make this shit up. They mention feelings more than hygiene\n\n&gt; As you may have heard, today public health officials announced that\u00a0the first death in the United States attributed to the novel coronavirus has occurred in King County. While this individual was not a UW student or employee, our hearts are with his family and friends during this time of tremendous loss. They\u2019re also with those who have been affected by this outbreak directly, including through the impact on their loved ones, and through heightened anxiety and fear, discriminatory experiences or economic loss.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that thus far the vast majority of people who have become ill with COVID-19 (the disease caused by the novel coronavirus) have experienced relatively mild symptoms, such as fever and cough.\u00a0As of this writing, fewer than 10 individuals in Washington have been diagnosed with this disease. One of them has already recovered and returned to a normal life, and we expect others will follow.\u00a0Currently, no members of the UW community have been diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nI write today to ensure you are aware of how the University is working with public health officials to be as prepared as possible to protect the health of the UW community.\n\nWe are extremely fortunate to live in a region with outstanding medical services and public health infrastructure and are optimistic that these significant investments in public health preparedness will support a rapid, effective response. At the UW, we are working closely with local and state public health officials and following\u00a0guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\u00a0to align our plans with the most current recommendations from experts. This includes encouraging everyone to monitor their own health, practice good hygiene and stay home if feeling sick.\n\nUniversity preparations\nThe University has extensive and thorough emergency procedures, and will do everything it can to ensure the health and safety of our community.\n\nOut of an abundance of caution, we are making the same types of preparations that we would for any other potentially disruptive situation, such as a natural disaster. This includes working with campus leadership and\u00a0regional public health partners\u00a0to help colleges, schools and departments take steps that can minimize disruptions to student learning, such as assessing their readiness to conduct class activities online, should that be required, and ensuring students and employees who are ill can be properly supported so they can stay home and recover. We are also making similar preparations related to maintaining our vital research, service and patient care missions in the event of a disruption. Further guidance for staff, faculty and other academic personnel will be forthcoming.\n\nEven if these measures are not ultimately needed, ensuring we are prepared for disruptions now will serve us well in the future.\n\nWhat you can do\nMany people are asking what they can do. Community preparation helps us support and care for each other. Here are\u00a0actions you can take\u00a0to help us all stay as healthy as possible:\n\nStay informed\nRefer to and share\u00a0the UW\u2019s coronavirus FAQ page, which\u00a0is developed in close consultation with public health officials and includes information about considerations for travel, steps to take if you feel sick and resources for UW community members. There are also updates available from the\u00a0Washington State Department of Health\u00a0and\u00a0county public health departments.\n\nPractice good hygiene\n\nStay home from work and school when you feel sick.\n\nCover your mouth and nose with your elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze, and immediately dispose of the tissue.\n\nWash your hands often with soap and water, for at least 20 seconds, and if soap and water are not available use a 60-95% alcohol-based hand sanitizer.\n\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.\n\nClean and disinfect surfaces that are frequently touched.\n\n\nRemain calm and show compassion\nData on COVID-19 is still emerging, and the\u00a0Washington State Department of Health\u00a0is reporting that while the immediate health risk from COVID-19 has increased with the newly diagnosed cases in our region, for the general public it still remains low. And as a reminder, the vast majority of individuals with the disease experience mild symptoms.\n\nAdditionally, it is vital that we support each other and act as a community, avoiding acts of discrimination and bias, and showing compassion for those affected by this disease. This virus poses a global challenge \u2014 it requires a unified response.\n\nAgain, we are taking all necessary precautions and are working with public health officials to prioritize your health and safety. Please continue to be kind and respectful to each other. We are best equipped to deal with any threat to health when we work together.\n\nWe will continue to provide you with updates as we have them, including through University-wide email messages when warranted and on\u00a0the UW\u2019s coronavirus FAQ page.", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1583139720, "author": "biskitwheels", "link_id": "t3_fc94qw", "parent_id": "t3_fc94qw", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": true, "fear": true, "joy": true, "love": false, "optimism": true, "pessimism": false, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fk98j9m": {"body": "Ok fine, yes joe Rogan can be too easy on alt righties like that incel fight club group made by one ex vice guy, Jordan Peterson (hypocrite who couldn't take his own advice and became a junkie hell-bent on causing brain damage by artificially inducing a coma to wean his addiction) and etc. But he is one of few people that have Bernie a far chance to articulate himself, while the media vilifies and isolates him\n\nAnd Joe Rogan himself is against trump bcoz of his policy of  separating and caging kids, heck he was like if u do that, u ain't allowed to have a polite conversation bcoz u re the freaking enemy. \n\nPs I wasn't racist, as by idol I meant trump, and I meant that he might be infected with Corona bcoz he was with rep Matt , who got infected after calling it a Democrat hoax.", "subreddit": "SandersForPresident", "created_utc": 1583970915, "author": "alv0694", "link_id": "t3_fh1ki3", "parent_id": "t1_fk8l8nn", "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": false, "disgust": true, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fgj2zqh": {"body": "**With this new coronavirus outbreak, working from home is no longer a privilege, it\u2019s a necessity.**\n\nThe sanitary risk of a 2019-nCoV outbreak in New York City is an opportunity for most companies to test working from home at scale.\n\nApart from contributing to a healthier environment, helping employers and employees save money on transportation and office space, and promoting equal opportunities in the employment market, working from home might be the most efficient containment measure each individual could\u00a0take part of.\n\nOf course, working from home is not ideal, it's a skill, it takes time to acquire, both for employees and employers.

So job growth has actually slowed under Trump.

So your claim that his tax cuts improved the economy have no merit. \n\n&gt;He somehow won the trade war with China, which i didn't even agree with.\n\nNo he didn't and the article in the following comment that you linked only said that China reduced its retaliation tariffs by half, not that they lowered existing tariffs or lost the trade war. As a matter of fact, China's decision to reduce its retaliation tariffs was only made AFTER Trump decided to cut his tariffs in half, which is explained in your own article. \n\n&gt;He got us out of NAFTA.\n\nThere's no evidence this improved the stock market. Stock's actually remained relatively the same after the announcement and the creation of the USMCA.\n\n&gt;You're turn. How is he responsible for this drop?\n\nSo none of your sources or examples actually substantiate that Trump's policies increased the stock market. \n\nIn regards to this stock market drop, it's quite possible that if Trump retained a better relationship with China, then China would have been willing to work more honestly and directly with the U.S. in trying to contain the outbreak, instead of lying about it. This could have allowed us and the rest of the world to be better prepared for the outbreak. \n\nA whistle-blower details how federal health workers were improperly trained by Trump's administration before coming into contact with people being monitored for the coronavirus. This leads to increased fears that Trump's government has no idea what they're doing and is just more evidence of his overall ineptitude.

People over 75k must have a savings account unless you've spent all your god damn money on stupid crap outside of your budget; the 30-75k adults with families are going to get hit the hardest, because the health care bills, rent or mortgage, car bills, etc. add up.\n\nIf you're in that bracket between your wife (1200 each) and your kid (500), you will be eligible for $2900 which is quite a lot of money for a relief fund. If you're a single young adult who made little to no money in 2018 due to schooling or health issues or some other case, but now have a good job and raised living expenses, which there will be many of these exceptions, they need to make provisions to help these people.\n\nThe thing is , people in the lowest income bracket already are eligible for things like medicaid, food stamps and welfare. They need to get these checks out right now and be prepared for more in the next 2 months. Meanwhile, what they should be doing is freezing all student loans, putting health care measures in place so that people aren't left with $10k bills from getting an ICU treatment from Corona, and getting more food banks and stamps ready for the unemployed service sector.\n\nThis system was so fragile and f\\*\\*\\*ed. I'm all for single-payer health and taxing more for infrastructure, but the way the US economy and government are setup, it's impulsive to pass a gigantic unemployment package for every citizen while the US Dollar is actually at risk of hyper inflating.\n\nI live in a city so I know our expenses are higher, but as far as a federal help, the 600/1200/0 is in the ball-park. At the state and city levels, governments can offer more assistance and programs for expensive places like Bay Area, NYC, etc. What's the largest group that this 2018 Tax bill will affect? The fresh college graduates. I'm not saying it's a fair situation, but if you had to make a choice, then the 21-24yo population who had no job in 2018 but now has been working should absolutely be fine with a $600 bailout unless they decided to live WAY beyond their means - freeze the student loans, and as this crisis deepens, consider freezing rent/mortgage/auto-loans and health care payments. But not everybody needs a massive check right now.\n\nI know there's gonna be some bull shit fine-print in this bill, but they need to pass this quick, and I think arguing semantics about these checks is the last thing they should fight about.

You don't care about animals. It doesn't matter if I know you. \n\nFlipside; Why is it okay to eat plantlife but not animal life? They are alive too, just because they don't move or make sounds makes them less important? Nothing lives without exploiting something else, it's simply how you do so that matters. \n\n&gt;How are we blind to the rest of the world? Are you making the (false) assumption that vegans are unaware of other issues? Or that the world is unable to address multiple issues? Or that people are able to have multiple concerns? This doesn't make sense. For clarity I've gone to a political rally in just the past week. I'm well aware of other issues.\n\nIn 90% if my interactions with Vegans (radical and not) yes, that is what I am saying. The majority cannot see beyond their quest to end consumption of meat, rarely think about how that would affect many peoples livelihoods, not to mention what would happen to the literal millions of cows/pigs/chickens/etc that exist solely for consumption? \n\n\n&gt;Rice and beans. Lasts forever and cheap as hell. It's much cheaper than meat (even canned). That's a pretty weak argument since rice and beans are cheap and plentiful all over the world. \n\nOh my gods, shut up about rice and beans. Rice is not healthy, and not everyone likes or can even eat beans. You're complaining about how much land is used by farmers for their animals but how much land would you need to grow your massive supply of rice and beans? Same issue. \n\n&gt;Uh... It seems like you're almost getting it. You know it's wrong to take a life, but why isn't it wrong to eat their corpse? \n\n\nGray area; It's not always wrong to take a life, extenuating circumstances are always a thing. \nNot to mention, if the animal is already dead what does it matter that it is eaten? Nature is as nature does. If people don't eat them something else will. That's how it is, circle of life and all that crap. \n\n&gt;People's continued unethical actions do not give me credence to act unethically. \"Two wrongs don't make a right.\" Just because people will continue to litter doesn't mean I should throw my garbage on the sidewalk. \n\n\nThat's not what I said. I didn't say you shouldn't continue advocating for animal welfare, but the fact is the regular person on the street has little power over the corporations that cause the actual problems. Education is key, but we currently live in an age where people do not want to be educated, and aside from tying them down and forcing your opinion on them that isn't going to change either.  You can advocate all you want, and do what works for you, but don't expect everyone else to follow. \n\n&gt;You don't see the big picture. If you could take the wool off your eyes you would begin to see. The leading cause of death in the world is heart disease from animal products. Animal agriculture is a significant contributor to climate change. It is the main driver to the habitat destruction and the extinction of species. Zoonotic diseases from animal consumption are a huge pandemic risk and we're in the midst of one right now from eating animals. The consumption of animal products lead to a litany of diseases and cancers that are entirely avoidable. Even if none of that was true, you would still be killing an innocent animal whose only crime to be killed for you to eat them was to exist. \n\n\nHeart disease does not only come from animal consumption, that's genetics. It does affect and worsen it, yes, but it is not the sole cause. Like sugar and diabetes, they correlate but one does not cause the other. \n\n\nAgreed on the Agriculture stance. \n\n\nThey have yet to actually figure out where Covid-19 came from, right now it is still speculation. If it did come from the Chinese eating bats or pangolins, then good. Maybe it will save the endangered animals from being totally decimated by their uneducated way of thinking. \n\n\nSaying it again; Nothing can live without exploiting something else.

What rights do parents who have to work have? The most important answers.\n\n**Are employees allowed to stay at home with their children when the daycare or school closes?**\n\nUnder certain conditions, this is possible for a short time, with continued pay. The basis for this is \u00a7 616 of the German Civil Code (\"temporary prevention\").\n\nParents must have checked intensively beforehand whether there is another possibility of care. For this purpose, the upcoming weekend must also be used. A practical problem here could be that many families would like to call on grandparents in emergencies, but are currently advised against contact with grandchildren. Older people are at risk for the new coronavirus.\n\nIf no care at all is found quickly, employees are allowed to stay at home for a few days and continue to be paid wages. But it is important to note that this is by no means a permanent solution. In any case, you should inform your employer if you cannot come to work spontaneously - and check whether the rights of \u00a7 616 have perhaps been excluded in the employment or collective agreement. At least that is possible.\n\n**And what can parents do in the long run?**\n\nThey should then examine various possibilities. Can I take paid leave? If that is not possible or if there are not enough holidays: Can I take unpaid leave? Or can I perhaps work from home?\n\nHome office would of course mean actually working from home, possibly at more flexible times than in the office. All these things should definitely be discussed with the employer and amicable solutions sought.\n\n**What applies to civil servants and public employees?**\n\nThere will also be solutions for emergencies, but a final answer is not yet possible at the moment. For federal civil servants there are rules on paid \"special leave\" for a few days. The wording does not fit exactly to a school closure, but could possibly be applied here.\n\nFor state officials, the individual states must now say whether similar rules exist locally. For employees in the public sector, there are rules in the collective agreement that could allow for short-term leave of absence due to school closures. Those affected should quickly obtain information from their employer.\n\n**Can I take my child to work with me as an exception?**\n\nThat might be difficult. In any case, you have no right to it, it would only be possible in agreement with the employer. In the current situation, however, many bosses would certainly point out that social contacts should be avoided if possible.\n\nMany of these questions were raised some time ago during the daycare strikes. The dimension of Corona, however, is quite different. There will be an enormous need for flexible solutions in childcare - with enormous challenges for parents and employers.\n\nTranslated with [www.DeepL.com/Translator](https://www.DeepL.com/Translator) (free version)", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1584100942, "author": "dark101000add10", "link_id": "t3_fhyiw8", "parent_id": "t3_fhyiw8", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fho2abj": {"body": "Not absurd in anyway.  More and more scientists are coming to the same conclusion when they put the pieces together:\n\n A pre-print published by Botao Xiao and Lei Xiao, titled \"The possible origins of 2019-nCoV coronavirus\" whose abstract is the following...\n\nThe 2019-nCoV has caused an epidemic of 28,060 laboratory-confirmed infections in human including 564 deaths in China by February 6, 2020. Two descriptions of the virus published on Nature this week indicated that the genome sequences from patients were almost identical to the Bat CoV ZC45 coronavirus. It was critical to study where the pathogen came from and how it passed onto human. An article published on The Lancet reported that 27 of 41 infected patients were found to have contact with the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan. We noted two laboratories conducting research on bat coronavirus in Wuhan, one of which was only 280 meters from the seafood market. We briefly examined the histories of the laboratories and proposed that the coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory. Our proposal provided an alternative origin of the coronavirus in addition to natural recombination and intermediate host.\n\nIn summary, somebody was entangled with the evolution of 2019-nCoV coronavirus. In addition to origins of natural recombination and intermediate host, the killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan. \n\nWho is Botao and should anyone listen to him? Well, yes: this is what we find about the research group of the Harvard post-doc:\n\nThe Xiao group study mainly in the fields of cellular and molecular biomechanics, single molecule biophysics and engineering. Current research areas are: protein-ligand interactions, DNA and RNA assembly, high-throughput nanometer measurements and manipulation, mathematical modeling and quantitative analysis. The experimental techniques include: magnetic tweezers, optical tweezers, biomembrane force probe, fluorescent microscopy, genetic engineering, and chromatography. An project example is using high-throughput single molecule techniques to study the modulation of protein drugs on interactions of integrins and their ligands such as TGF-beta. We also study von Willebrand Factor and glycoproteins on platelets. We collaborate with a number of well-known universities and institutions, and a few enterprises. Our research will be of relevance for the prevention and treatment of cancer, immune and cardiovascular diseases.\n\nBut what is far more interesting, and important, is that the paper was supported by China's National Natural Science Foundation, which means that the paper would likely never see the light of day if someone in Beijing did not stand to gain politically by endorsing the contrarian theory that a Wuhan biolab was indeed the source of the infection.\n\nWhich begs the question: is China's political elite set to change the narrative it has been spinning since day one about the origins of the coronavirus, and in order to appease an increasingly angry population, points the finger to one or more scientists at the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention and/or Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\nThe possible origins of 2019-nCoV coronavirus\n\nBotao Xiao1,2* and Lei Xiao3\n\n1 Joint International Research Laboratory of Synthetic Biology and Medicine, School of Biology and Biological Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China\n\n2 School of Physics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, China\n\n3 Tian You Hospital, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430064, China\n\nCorresponding author: xiaob@scut.edu.cn\n\nTel / Fax: 86-20-3938-0631", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1581739152, "author": "DoctorScrotus", "link_id": "t3_f43j5c", "parent_id": "t3_f43j5c", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fjht1vn": {"body": "## Grand Princess Cruise Ship Quarentined by CDC\n\nToday, 02:51 PM**Grand Princess Health Advisory**\n\n**Updated March 4, 2020**\n\nLast night / early this morning, our chief medical officer Dr. Grant Tarling issued this Health Advisory Letter to guests and crew currently sailing onboard Grand Princess. A similar notification has been emailed to guests who sailed on the previous voyage. For guests who sailed on the previous Grand Princess voyage (Feb 11-21), if you have experienced any symptoms of acute respiratory illness with fever, chills, or cough since your return home, please immediately contact your medical provider. You can also [view the COVID-19 information card (PDF)](https://www.princess.com/news/pdfs/cdc-covid-19-info-card.pdf) provided by the CDC. **Guests Health Advisory \u2013 CoronavirusMarch 4, 2020**\n\nDear Princess Guest:\n\nI wish to advise you that today we have been notified by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that they are investigating a small cluster of COVID-19 (coronavirus) cases in Northern California connected to our previous *Grand Princess* voyage that sailed roundtrip San Francisco from February 11 to February 21. We are working closely with our CDC partners and are following their recommendations.\n\nFor those guests who sailed with us on our previous voyage and may have been exposed, in an abundance of caution, the CDC requires you to remain in your stateroom until you have been contacted and cleared by our medical staff. A member of our medical team will be calling you between the hours of 8:00 AM and 11:00 AM this morning. You may order room service while you wait for the medical screening to be completed, and we apologize for any inconvenience.\n\nPlease be assured that the health, safety, and well-being of all guests and crew are our absolute priority. The CDC is continuing to actively collect information and has set up a meeting with us this morning to determine what, if any, actions need to be taken during this cruise and on arrival in San Francisco. We have shared essential travel and health data with the CDC to facilitate their standard notification to the State and County health authorities to follow up with individuals who may have been exposed to people who became ill.\n\nAs we anticipate that further review of the situation will be necessary on arrival in San Francisco, we will be cancelling the call to Ensenada on Thursday, March 5, in order to sail directly to San Francisco and arrive on Thursday afternoon. We will keep you updated with information as we finalize plans. To assist you in contacting your family, we are providing free internet and phone service. We will advise you if the need arises to make changes to your onward travel plans post-cruise.\n\nCOVID-19 causes mild illness in about 80% of cases, typically with symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath, like the common cold or flu. About 20% of people develop more severe symptoms. The more severe symptoms typically occur in more susceptible individuals that have higher risk factors, such as older adults and those with chronic medical conditions, as it does with regular flu. The illness is mainly spread by droplets from close person-to-person contact. It is possible for the virus to spread by hand touch surfaces, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Updated information on the illness can be found at the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/).\n\nAs with all respiratory illnesses, particularly during cold and flu season, you can take steps to reduce your risk of illness:\n\n1. Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds.\n2. Supplement hand washing by regularly using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.\n3. Avoid close contact with people suffering from respiratory illness.\n4. Cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze using a tissue or your bent elbow.\n5. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.\n\nWe are closely recording and monitoring all persons who have reported to the medical center with cold and flu symptoms during the voyage. As a precaution, we are also conducting additional enhanced environmental disinfection onboard in addition to our regular stringent cleaning and sanitation protocols.\n\nIf you have experienced any symptoms of acute respiratory illness with fever, chills, or cough at any time during this cruise, and you have not already consulted with the medical staff, please immediately contact the Medical Center to report your illness. There will not be a charge for this service.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this important information.\n\nTo access complimentary internet, turn on your Wi-Fi and access the \u201cocean\u201d network for connection.\n\nYours in health,\n\nGrant Tarling, MD, MPHChief Medical Officer\n\nAP \u2013 In-Transit - Guests v1.0\n\nEDIT More news on this:\n\n[https://www.cruiselawnews.com/2020/03/articles/disease/covid-19-grand-princess-under-quarantine-for-coronavius-after-passenger-on-prior-cruise-becomes-critically-ill/](https://www.cruiselawnews.com/2020/03/articles/disease/covid-19-grand-princess-under-quarantine-for-coronavius-after-passenger-on-prior-cruise-becomes-critically-ill/)", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1583354538, "author": "InternetCaesar", "link_id": "t3_fdjdb3", "parent_id": "t3_fdjdb3", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fgualg9": {"body": "&gt; # Chinese aerobatics team passed all health checks: Ng Eng Hen\n\n&gt; The Chinese air force's aerobatics team took extra precautions, met Singapore's criteria for health, and passed all checks before they arrived here for the upcoming airshow, said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen yesterday.\n\n&gt; That both the Chinese and United States air forces are here for the biennial event, running from next Tuesday until Feb 16, testifies to Singapore's ties with the two countries, he added. \"It's really a vote of confidence.

This seems like a lot of sinophobia.\n\nIt's really not.

Pandemic flu has been a major concern for a long time and a consistent contender for the list of potential global disasters that could seriously knock back our civilisation.  Many experts have pointed at China as a major risk area of this happening for a long time due to the way they directly mix together animals of difference species in their farms and markets. \n\nAtm the known mortality rate of Wuhan coronavirus is believed to be about 2% higher than influenza so at the very minimum that's an extra 180,000 deaths a year in the US (if it becomes uncontainable) but for all we know that information may be very wrong.  The scientists do not have a proper handle on this at all yet so it may be much more infectious than common strains of influenza, it may have a higher mortality rate than we think, we don't know how quickly it mutates and there is no vaccine available for an estimate of at least 6 months.  We recently found out that it's infectious before a patient becomes symptomatic which may indicate the spread of the virus is much worse than we feared as people will have been walking around spreading the virus without realising they are seriously ill and Xi Jinping called the situation \"grave\" which is pretty alarming language from a country that tends to downplay the seriousness of any internal issues.  The absolute worst case would be that it's highly infectious, it goes global, it mutates often making vaccines worthless and it either has a higher mortality rate than is being revealed or it mutates from it's current form to have a higher mortality rate to match something like SARS (another coronavirus) that killed almost 10% of the people it infected.

The spending plan included a 16 percent reduction in CDC funding from the 2020 spending levels.\n\nIn fact, all of Trump\u2019s budget proposals have called for cuts to CDC funding, but Congress has intervened each time by passing spending bills with year-over-year increases for the CDC that Trump then signed into law.  \n[Did Donald Trump fire pandemic officials, defund CDC?](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/feb/28/michael-bloomberg/did-donald-trump-fire-pandemic-officials-defund-cd/)\n\nOn the first point, it\u2019s hard to pin down whether the National Security Council staffers were \"fired\" in 2018, but they certainly left abruptly and have not been replaced, though other leaders in the coronavirus fight have been named in recent days.\n\nOn the second point \u2014 funding \u2014 there\u2019s no question that the Trump administration sought to cut key CDC budget categories that would be involved in emerging infections like coronavirus.

The full extent of what this virus has effected has finally set in for me. My reasoning for this realization is a bit selfish, and I am/have been deeply concerned for and feel sorry for those effected, but sometimes something doesn\u2019t become real for you until it effects you personally. \n\n   Recently I (14F) have been having a lot of back pain. It started about a month and a half ago when I pulled/injured something during my PE safety test. It steadily got worse over a few weeks, and when I asked my gym teacher she told me \u201cyou probably just pulled a muscle,  it hurts, but if you stretch you should be fine\u201d. So I followed her advice and it only really hurt if I slept on it funny, so I moved forward, didn\u2019t think anything of it. I\u2019ve had back pain before, no big deal. \n\n   Fast forward to about Thursday last week. I went to move a chair, and before I had even lifted it, my back went out. I Don\u2019t know exactly what is wrong, how I hurt it, what exactly I did to it, etc. All I know is that it hurt. This time it hurt far worse than when I originally hurt it, but again I stretched it and took it easy, and by Saturday evening I was pretty much fine. \n\n   Skip again to this morning. I was going up some stairs to go to my room, where it was quiet, so that I could take a test. As I was going up the stairs my back went out again. This time it was far worse than either if the other times. The pain was absolutely excruciating. It felt worse then when I had broken my arms, or dislocated my knee cap. It was by far the worst pain I\u2019ve ever felt. Throughout the day my parents have done whatever they could to help the situation at home, I\u2019ve been taking aleve, laying down, heating pad, TENS machine, etc. It feels better, but not good, and I don\u2019t know what to do about it. \n\n   Okay, here\u2019s the COVID-19 part. Ordinarily, by now my parents would have taken me to the doctor, and today I would have been in the ER, but obviously do to Covid, that isn\u2019t an option. There are just too many health risks. And if any of us were possibly exposed to it, my dad wouldn\u2019t be able to go to work. Not to even mention we have my immunocompromised  grandmother to protect. I know I would still have been in pain at the hospital, but they are also aloud to prescribe better pain medicine, and get to the root of my problem to potentially fix it. \n\n   I also had the realization that there are probably tons of other people who are struggling with their own health issues, but can\u2019t go to the hospital because of COVID-19, and it really sucks to lie around in pain and not be able to get any treatment. So I know it\u2019s selfish, and I know that there are a lot of people dying from the virus, and I wish that no one had to go through that, but for me it didn\u2019t get real until today. \n\nTL;DR: \nIt got real for me today when I wasn\u2019t able to go to the doctor after getting hurt because of COVID-19.", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "created_utc": 1585026211, "author": "33MissTori33", "link_id": "t3_fnszg7", "parent_id": "t3_fnszg7", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": true, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": true, "optimism": true, "pessimism": false, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fj3gprp": {"body": " \n\nAlmost 100 foreign citizens who had been in China \u2014 many of them \u201cbusiness leaders\u201d \u2014 were snuck in Australia\u2019s back door after the federal government gave them an exemption from the coronavirus travel ban.\n\nIt is understood the business leaders, diplomats and other travellers allowed to enter Australia passed an initial health screening and state health departments rubber-stamped the request.

I've had to do a lot of writing on the FSMA for work, and no kidding, most of the outbreaks of foodborne illnesses we've had in the US the past have been because a deer or other got into the fields and took a dump and not because  someone forgot to wash their hands. \n\nLogistically speaking food processing and warehouses have a lot of automation. Transport wise truckers could get the virus and spread it. However, they lead busy but solitary lives that are spent mostly in a cab driving or sleeping. I'm inclined to think that they might actually have more insulation against contracting the virus than people in most walks of life.\n\nWe depend on power and water, but the grid is fairly robust. In urban areas we irritated if the power is knocked out for more than an hour because power companies can usually fix it by then. The supply chains that supply power companies with fuel are pretty solid, and once again automation and mechanization have made them a lot less dependent on labor. The water grid is more robust than the power in my experience. I've been through about thirteen hurricanes and while I've lost power in most of them I never lost water service.\n\nThe developing world may be another story. There are places where subsistence farming is still found, and they might lose more people than they can manage without. India and large swathes of sub-Saharan Africa have large populations that live without reliable access to clean water, or power and that is likely to make the fatality rate go up there. The west coast of the US, and several other cities have large homeless populations and the coronavirus is likely to be devastating to them. Now, I was homeless for awhile so when I say this please bear in mind that this was something I realized about my own plight. The people who are most likely to be seriously harmed by this are those that are already living outside of  society, and in a practical and very real sense they don't matter to society as a whole. They can die and the rest of the world won't notice at all. In a lot of cases their epitaph would be someone being relieved that the panhandler wasn't harassing them, or that their were fewer people outside of the Home Depot. Society would just go on without them.\n\nAs far as the disruption of the virus to society as a whole goes in the developed world I think it's more likely to be a severe economic slump. Lots of people exhausting their savings while they can't go into work. Companies laying people off while sales are down. Hardship made worse by more funerals, and more unexpected funerals than we can stand.

The over-riding objective is to protect life. Sadly 21 people have already died in the UK, and the fact that most had underlying health conditions does not make the grief of their families any lesser, nor our compassion for their family and friends any weaker. We must all do everything in our power to tackle this virus.\n\nWe have a plan, based on the expertise of world-leading scientists. Herd immunity is not a part of it. That is a scientific concept, not a goal or a strategy. Our goal is to protect life from this virus, our strategy is to protect the most vulnerable and protect the NHS through contain, delay, research and mitigate.\n\nWe are working through our clear action plan. Like all our decisions, the plan is based on the bedrock of the science, with maximum transparency. We will do the right thing at the right time, based on the best available science.\u00a0\n\nTo protect life, we must protect the vulnerable, and protect the NHS and flatten the curve.\n\nFrom the moment coronavirus emerged, we have followed those goals.\n\nWe have acted to contain the spread of the virus so far. We have carried out some of the highest number of tests in Europe, our surveillance testing is among the most sophisticated in the world and the UK\u2019s plans for the rapid response to and mitigation of the spread of an epidemic are ranked number one above any other country by the Global Health Security Index. Most importantly of all, thanks to our record levels of tracing the number of people who came into contact with the first people who caught the virus, the initial growth was slowed significantly, and the growth of the virus in the UK has been slower than many major European countries. This action has already prevented the NHS being put under greater pressure in its hardest season of the year. We have bought valuable time to prepare.\n\nLast week we stepped into the next phase of our response. We took action to advise anyone with symptoms, however mild, to stay at home. This advice from the Chief Medical Officer will be reinforced with a national communications campaign so everyone knows what they can do: how you can play your part. The new campaign will set out the latest clinical advice, for people to stay at home for seven days if they develop a high temperature or new continuous cough.\u00a0 We can all keep doing our bit by continuing to wash our hands more often, for 20 seconds or more and having plenty of tissues around to \u2018catch it, bin it, kill it\u2019. Following this new advice may sound simple, but it could be lifesaving for others around us, especially the most vulnerable.\n\nToday, we take further action, with a call to arms for a drive to build the ventilators and other equipment the NHS will need. We are better equipped thanks to the NHS than most other countries, but we will need many more. We now need any manufacturers to transform their\u00a0production lines to make ventilators. We cannot make too many.\n\nIn the near future we will take further steps. SAGE has advised the next planned effective interventions will need to be instituted soon, including measures to \u2018shield\u2019 older and medically vulnerable people from the virus. Everyone will need to help to ensure they get the support they need to stay at home, and to protect them from the consequences of isolation: loneliness, and a lack of support. Government, local councils, charities, friends and neighbours will need to be part of the national effort to support the shielded. We will provide expert advice and support as soon as we progress to this phase.\n\nNext week we will publish our emergency bill, to give the Government the temporary powers we will need to help everyone get through this. The measures in it allow for the worst case scenario. I hope many of them won\u2019t be needed. But we will ask Parliament for these powers in case they are.\n\nOur generation has never been tested like this. Our grandparents were, during the Second World War, when our cities were bombed during the Blitz. Despite the pounding every night, the rationing, the loss of life, they pulled together in one gigantic national effort.\n\nToday our generation is facing its own test, fighting a very real and new disease. We must fight the disease to protect life. Everyone will be asked to make sacrifices, to protect themselves and others, especially those most vulnerable to this disease. With our clear action plan, listening to the advice of the best science, and taking the action we all must, I am sure we will rise to this challenge.", "subreddit": "ukpolitics", "created_utc": 1584227056, "author": "Pro4TLZZ", "link_id": "t3_fird70", "parent_id": "t3_fird70", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": true, "love": true, "optimism": true, "pessimism": false, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": true, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fh4r49d": {"body": "As to more justification for things that I (and many others) don't want to see here is content like random YouTube videos with no proof or sources, random tweets with no proof or sources.

Further analysis indicates that some of the nCoV-2019 genes shared less than 80% nt sequence identity to SARS-CoV. However, the seven conserved replicase domains in ORF1ab that were used for CoV species classification, are 94.6% aa sequence identical between nCoV-2019 and SARS-CoV, implying the two belong to same species(Extended Data Table 3). We then found a short RdRp region from a bat coronavirus termed BatCoV RaTG13 which we previously detected in Rhinolophus affinisfrom Yunnan Province showed high sequence identity to nCoV-2019. We did full-length sequencing to this RNA sample. Simplot analysis showed that nCoV-2019 was highly similar throughout the genome to RaTG13 (Fig. 1c), with 96.2% overall genome sequence identity. The phylogenetic analysis also showed that RaTG13 is the closest relative of the nCoV-2019 and form a distinct lineage from other SARSr-CoVs (Fig. 1d). The receptor binding protein spike (S) gene was highly divergent to other CoVs (Extended Data Figure 2), with less than 75% nt sequence identity to all previously described SARSr-CoVs except a 93.1% nt identity to RaTG13 (Extended Data Table3). The S genes of nCoV-2019 and RaTG13 S gene are longer than other SARSr-CoVs. The major differences in nCoV-2019 are the three short insertions in the N-terminal domain, and four out of five key residues changes in the receptor-binding motif, in comparison  \n&gt;  \n&gt;with SARS-CoV (Extended Data Figure 3). The close phylogenetic relationship to 96RaTG13 provides evidence for a bat origin of nCoV-2019.\n\nHijacking to paste this", "subreddit": "China_Flu", "created_utc": 1580506020, "author": "RingedStag", "link_id": "t3_ewt9ep", "parent_id": "t1_fg4g25e", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": true}, "complete": false}, "fji6imr": {"body": "COVID-19 : Let's do a Work-From-Home experiment in New York\n\nVOTE HERE: http://chng.it/h9CgB5wq\n\nWith this new coronavirus outbreak, working from home is no longer a privilege, it\u2019s a necessity.\nThe sanitary risk of a 2019-nCoV outbreak in New York City is an opportunity for most companies to test working from home at scale.\n\nApart from contributing to a healthier environment, helping employers and employees save money on transportation and office space, and promoting equal opportunities in the employment market, working from home might be the most efficient containment measure each individual could take part of.\n\nOf course, working from home is not ideal, it's a skill, it takes time to acquire, both for employees and employers.

It\u2019s just not reasonable to think with the number of confirmed cases spread all over the country that they haven\u2019t all been responsible for some level of community transfer. And any confirmed cases at this point are only the most severely ill which means they\u2019ve had the virus for a relatively long time and have probably come into contact with a larger group of people. \n\nIt ALSO means, by definition of the test eligibility criteria, that we have intentionally not tested a whole lot of people who were showing symptoms. We\u2019ve heard many stories now of people basically begging to be tested and the CDC refused to authorize the test. So in addition to the community transfer of the confirmed cases, we have a much larger population of people that the CDC refuses to test. And remember, 80% of all cases fall in the \u201cmild symptom\u201d category. \n\nSo if the CDC will only authorize severely symptomatic patients who meet strict criteria to be tested, then isn\u2019t it reasonable to think that only the 20% \u201csickest\u201d patients would get tested? So the confirmed count is, I think, conservatively only 20% of the cases currently in the US. So I think, at a minimum, the real number of infected is 5x greater than the current count, and that\u2019s just doing the simple math based on what we know about the testing criteria and the severity ratios of the virus, add in the fact that most likely not even all severe cases have been identified yet and I think the number could realistically be quite a bit more. \n\nSo that\u2019s a whole lot of unconfirmed cases of the Corona virus.

They include a Placer County man who died of COVID-19 on Wednesday.\n\nAt least 21 of the nearly 3,000 people who subsequently took the same ship to Hawaii have tested positive for the virus. All of those passengers remain on board, and many more still need to be tested. It\u2019s unclear what will happen to those who are found to be sick.\n\nA cruise line medical officer said Saturday that the man who died brought the virus with him when he boarded the Grand Princess \u2014 a point public health officials disputed.\n\nDr. Grant Tarling, the cruise\u2019s medical officer, said the man \u2014 who died at Kaiser Permanente Roseville Medical Center after leaving the ship \u2014 sought medical care onboard on Feb. 20 and had been sick for several days. Tarling said two waiters who served the man multiple times were subsequently infected.\nIf true, it could mean there was so-called community spread of the virus in California earlier than had previously been detected.\n\nA Placer County health officer, however, questioned Tarling\u2019s statement and said the passenger probably contracted the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 while on the cruise.\n\n\u201cPlacer County Public Health has been consistent in our message that our first COVID-19-related fatality likely contracted the disease during international travel to Mexico,\u201d Dr. Aimee Sisson said. \u201cAs is standard public health practice, we have based our assessment on the information learned in our contact investigation as well as what we know to be true about the disease pattern.\u201d\nThough Princess Cruises officials indicated the short period between the Placer County man boarding the ship and the onset of his symptoms suggested he brought the virus on board, the incubation period for COVID-19 is still unkonwn. The World Health Organization puts it between one and 14 days, most commonly around five days.\n\nDr. Thomas Frieden, former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the Obama administration, agreed the average incubation period was five to six days, with a range between two days and two weeks.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t yet know when people who have symptoms are infectious, and for how long,\u201d Frieden said.\nCoronavirus cases had been confirmed in California as early as January, tied to travel from China.\nThe 75-year-old Placer County man said his symptoms began two to three days after boarding the Grand Princess, according to Tarling.\n\nPresident Trump has expressed concern that allowing passengers to leave the ship would put the U.S. at risk of accelerating the coronavirus\u2019 spread. Federal and state officials have grappled with how to deal with the cruise ship, where 19 crew members and two passengers have tested positive for the virus.\n\nVice President Mike Pence said Saturday that officials have developed a plan for passengers that will be implemented this weekend.\n\n\u201cAll passengers and crew will be tested for coronavirus and quarantined as appropriate,\u201d he said in a meeting with cruise line executives and port directors in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. \u201cThose that require additional medical attention will also receive it.\u201d\n\nBut few other details have been released about the plan.\n\nAcross the state, 88 people had been infected with the virus as of Saturday morning. In the U.S., there have been at least 439 confirmed cases, with most in Washington state, where 108 people have tested positive and 16 have died. More than 100,000 people have been infected worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nIn California, it is the Grand Princess cruise ship that has been causing worry of a more widespread outbreak.\n\nBy Saturday, the state said a dozen passengers of the Grand Princess cruise that returned to San Francisco on Feb. 21 had tested positive for the virus. Local officials reported four cases in Placer County, two in Contra Costa County, two in Sonoma County and one each in Santa Cruz, Ventura, Madera and Alameda counties tied to the cruise.\n\nThe Placer County man who sailed to Mexico is the state\u2019s only confirmed COVID-19 fatality.\n\nThe Grand Princess was returning from Hawaii when it was held off the California coast. With testing still underway, officials don\u2019t know how many of the more than 3,000 people on board have the virus.\n\nFriday evening, gloves and masks were delivered to the cruise ship by helicopter, according to Negin Kamali, a spokeswoman for the Princess Cruises company. On Saturday morning, a critically ill passenger and their companion were evacuated from the ship by a Coast Guard cutter.\n\u201cThey are being transported to a shoreside medical facility for treatment unrelated to COVID-19,\u201d Kamali said. \u201cThe captain of Grand Princess and the Princess Cruises port operations team continue to await specific directives from state and local response operations about where the ship will proceed.\u201d\n\nPence, who leads the task force in charge of the response, said the federal government is working with the state of California to bring the cruise ship into a noncommercial port over the weekend and quarantine those on board as necessary.\n\nTrump said he would ultimately let Pence decide whether to allow passengers to leave the ship. But he said several times that he would be inclined to leave them on board because bringing them ashore would increase the number of official cases on American soil.\n\nPassengers on the vessel \u2014 both current and those who may have been exposed earlier \u2014 told the Los Angeles Times that the response to the outbreak by the company and health officials had been filled with missteps.\n\nIn particular, passengers said Princess Cruises was lax on health screening protocols prior to boarding and withheld information about the risks they faced, even as the ship\u2019s situation became international news.\n\nAt a White House briefing, federal public health officials could not say precisely how many people have been tested for the virus.\n\nThey said 5,861 specimens have been taken by federal, state and local public health labs. Most patients give at least two samples, one from the nose and a second from the throat.\n\nDr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, promised a massive expansion of testing availability in the coming days. The CDC has shipped out 75,000 tests to public labs in 48 states and 1.1 million tests to commercial labs, with another 1 million tests going out Monday.\n\nThat\u2019s enough for roughly 850,000 patients under the current protocols.\nMeanwhile, at the Long Beach harbor Saturday, passengers aboard the Carnival Panorama cruise ship were not allowed off the vessel while officials dealt with a \u201cmedical matter,\u201d according to a Facebook post by the cruise director.\nLong Beach city officials said on Twitter that a passenger aboard the ship was taken to a hospital and is being tested for the coronavirus. According to the cruise director, the passenger did not meet the CDC criteria for coronavirus risk.\nThe ship is docked at a Long Beach terminal, but \u201cin an abundance of caution, [the CDC] has decided to hold passengers on board until the patient can be evaluated,\u201d the city of Long Beach account tweeted.\n\nSiehara Kennedy, who is aboard the cruise ship, said passengers have been waiting more than three hours to get off. Passengers are not being isolated in their rooms and have been allowed to gather in the ship\u2019s bars and casino, she said.\nElsewhere in the state, concerns over the coronavirus has led to canceled classes and events. The Elk Grove Unified School District, the largest in Northern California, announced Saturday it would close schools and cancel all student activities \u2014 including a prom \u2014 for a week to buy time and decide next steps.\n\nSupt. Chris Hoffman said no students have tested positive for the virus, but some parents and family members have.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where this is going,\u201d he said in a news conference. \u201cI don\u2019t know that anybody knows where its going.\u201d\n\nWashington state, where 108 people have been infected, appears to be bearing the brunt of the U.S. outbreak. Fourteen of the state\u2019s 16 deaths are connected to the Life Care Center of Kirkland, a long-term care facility, according to Seattle &amp; King County Public Health. Officials said 15 people in the nursing facility have been hospitalized in the last 24 hours.\nIn New York, Gov. Andrew M.

We report to the patients the words that their family members give us on the phone, the cards with the messages and the drawings of the grandchildren they bring us, staying out. To relatives, we give news of the deaths on the phone. I had to communicate it to two children of a patient who live far apart. They couldn't even mourn him together. I'm not saying hold his hand, because we can't do it either. They die alone and are taken to a mortuary wrapped in a cloth with disinfectant.

This would provide immediate short term relief.\n\nIf/as the situation worsens, commercial air traffic will certainly be restricted or unavailable, thus providing additional aircraft and fuel reserves to draw upon.\n\n\nSincerely,", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1583264909, "author": "RGVChris", "link_id": "t3_fd08jd", "parent_id": "t3_fd08jd", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": true, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fkrm7zs": {"body": " depaywalled\n&gt; \n&gt; March 16, 2020 4:18 pm by David Bond \n\n&gt;With Europe now the centre of the coronavirus outbreak and countries such as Germany, Poland and Denmark closing their borders to try to contain the spread of the disease, EU leaders have introduced a package of measures to help its 27 member states cope with the crisis.\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sunday European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen announced an export authorisation scheme to prevent vital medical equipment leaving the bloc\u2019s single market and an accelerated procurement process to help member states secure ventilators and testing kits.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cWe need to keep goods flowing across Europe without obstacles,\u201d she said in a video statement. \u201cIn this moment of national crisis it is of utmost importance to keep our internal market going.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; For the UK government, determined to plough on with talks on its future relationship with Brussels after Brexit, this poses an awkward dilemma.\n&gt; \n&gt; Britain\u2019s formal exit from the EU on January 31 means it is no longer an EU member state. However, as part of the transition arrangement, agreed last October in Boris Johnson\u2019s withdrawal treaty and due to expire on December 31, the UK is still a part of the single market.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is also still paying money into the EU budget as part of a \u00a339bn divorce settlement \u2014 and while it may be difficult for the EU to sell it to its member governments, Britain should, in theory, be able to benefit from any EU-wide emergency funds.\n&gt; \n&gt; It should \u2014 again in theory \u2014 also be able to participate in the joint procurement process, although it is worth noting that the UK is no longer listed as a signatory to the Joint Procurement Agreement (JPA), first adopted by the EU in 2013 to help countries obtain vital medicines and vaccines to tackle previous cross-border health threats such as the swine flu pandemic, H1N1.\n&gt; \n&gt; The question for Mr Johnson, however, is whether it would be politically acceptable to ask Brussels for help \u2014 even if there are concerns in the UK over a shortage of the ventilators the NHS needs to treat patients with severe cases of coronavirus.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cAs long as we are in the single market there\u2019s no obvious reason that should stop us participating,\u201d said Anand Menon, director at the think-tank UK in a Changing Europe.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cBut the government is very sensitive to the perception that it needs the EU. Absurdly, given the situation we find ourselves in, the politics make that quite difficult to do.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Interestingly, the draft treaty for the UK-EU future relationship, published last week by Brussels, includes a section on health security co-operation. It was added after talks on the EU mandate last month and covers the UK\u2019s participation in an early warning system in the event of a crisis like the one we are seeing now.\n&gt; \n&gt; The draft treaty states: \u201cIn case of a serious cross-border threat to health, the Union may grant the United Kingdom, upon its written request, with ad hoc access to an Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) established within the Union, in respect of that particular threat, for the purposes of alerting, assessing public health risks and determining the measures that may be required to protect public health.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; The EU ultimately sees health emergencies such as the one unfolding now as a matter where national governments have to play the leading role \u2014 that\u2019s why they are prepared to accept the closure of national borders.\n&gt; \n&gt; But the UK will be acutely conscious of the need to maintain access to vital medical supplies and protective equipment in the coming weeks and months, some of which will be produced in the bloc.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, as part of its export ban proposal the commission explained that production of personal protective equipment such as mouth protection masks was limited to a small number of EU states: Czech Republic, France, Germany and Poland.\n&gt; \n&gt; Underlining the need for cross border co-operation, Ms von der Leyen added: \u201cNo country can produce on its own what it needs.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr Johnson has so far shown he is prepared to take a very different course compared with his closest European partners in fighting the coronavirus. But could the politics of Brexit prevent the UK prime minister from requesting much needed help from Brussels if the emergency in the UK becomes as serious as the situation in Italy?\n&gt;", "subreddit": "ukpolitics", "created_utc": 1584471601, "author": "ByGollie", "link_id": "t3_fkav3m", "parent_id": "t3_fkav3m", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": true, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fk6hxe5": {"body": "I'm a Bernie supporter.

I'll justify my reasoning below.\n\nLet's consider the following, and what it potentially means in terms of real deaths.\n\nStarting with the actions of the Chinese government historically and presently.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n\\- They've previously been caught out lying about SARS figures, lethality, infection rates and contagion spread multiple times in recent history. Both for \"saving face\" purposes and for economic and socioeconomic reasons. History showed the real figures to be significantly higher than the government information.\n\n\\- They're previously been caught lying and covering up real numbers and figures for Avian-flu and Swine-flu, for the same reasons as above. The real numbers were once again much worse than the official governmental line.\n\n\\- They've made it illegal to speak negatively about the governmental response to the outbreak, and have been actively arresting people who are simply sharing the real story of what is happening. The maximum jail term for sharing information through non-government channels is 7 YEARS in jail. 7 YEARS!\n\n\\-The Chinese government is actively arresting people for \"leaking\" any real information via social media to other parts of the country, and the rest of the world. These arrests include front line medical personnel and doctors\n\n\\-They've quarantined over 60 million people, this is not a normal response for a low threat virus.\n\n\\-There have been hundreds (thousands?) of videos coming out of Wuhan showing hospitals overflowing with people, people dying in corridors, people being carried out of buildings in body bags etc. Doctors breaking down in tears over the disaster.\n\n\\- This Virus is having a huge financial impact on Chine both domestically and internationally, and situation the government will do just about anything to mitigate regardless of ethical considerations. There is ample historical evidence to consider this a factual statement.\n\n\\-The WHO has raised the threat level of this Virus multiple times for the initial assessment.\n\n**Hearsay/anecdotal/non-official:**\n\n\\- Multiple experts in the WHO and virology field are reporting that they expect real infection numbers to be in the tens or hundreds of thousands.\n\n\\- Please keep in mind, all of these videos and reports and coming out DESPITE a huge governmental censorship and crackdown on social media, so it is reasonable to assume the reports would be orders of magnitude higher had China been a free and open democracy able to share this information free of consequence.\n\n\\- Medical professionals from multiple hospitals all reporting they are constantly running out of testing kits, medicine and having hundreds of people dying each day prior to even being tested and therefore not reported in official figures.\n\n\\- Multiple reports of crematoriums operating 24/7 throughout the province (previously operating only 4 hours a day), with bodies not even being identified correctly prior to being cremated.\n\n\\-Reports and videos for multiple sources of people waiting up to a WEEK to get tested for the virus, many of which are reported to have died at home and immediately cremated.\n\n\\-Percentages of foreigners having been evacuated from Wuhan showing the infection rate to be much higher than expected or reported from within China.\n\nVideos and reports of people dying in lines waiting to be seen at hospitals, reports of massive social unrest within Wuhan and Hubei.\n\n**The numbers:**\n\nFirstly, i fully acknowledge that statistics can be manipulated and played with to suit almost any narrative. So I've deliberately tried to keep figures relatively conservative but still based on non-official sources as this whole exercise is about predicting the actual situation, not the CCP reported one.\n\nLets assume the 50 million number of people quarantined in Hubei is relatively accurate.\n\nKeep in mind, this is just Hubei province, not the rest of China, or cases outside of China.\n\n**ULTRA CONSERVATIVE**\n\n.05% (only half of one percent) of people in quarantined area infected.\n\n= 250,000 people infected.\n\nLethality of only 1%\n\n= 2,500 dead\n\n**CONSERVATIVE**\n\n1% infection rate\n\n= 500,000 cases\n\n2% lethality (current official rate)\n\n= 10,000 dead.\n\n**SCARY BUT PLAUSIBLE**\n\n5% infection rate\n\n= 2,500,000 (2.5 million) cases\n\n5% lethality\n\n= 125,000 dead.\n\n**SARS LETHALITY**\n\n.05% Infection rate = 250,000 infected\n\nSARS lethality (9.6%) = 24,000 dead\n\n1% Infection rate = 500,000 infected\n\nSARS lethality (9.6%) = 48,000 dead\n\n5% Infection rate = 2,500,000 (2.5 million) cases\n\nSARS lethality (9.6%) = 240,000 dead.\n\n**WORTH REMEMBERING:**\n\nThese figures are ONLY for those in the quarantined zone, and do not include any of the provinces outside Hubei (which almost all are reporting cases of infection now) and does not include and statistics for cases internationally either.\n\nI'm aware this is an exercise in playing with numbers, however i think it's not only justifiable and plausible to have this conversation, but that the government response by many nations leads one to think they may be a lot closer to reality than the official reports we have been getting in the media.\n\nI'm happy to civilly discuss any of my above points.

Imagine a pandemic where 87 million people have a difficult time going to a doctor.\n\n&gt;The American people understand that climate change is an existential threat to our planet and we need to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels.\n\n&gt;The American people understand that we need to transform our broken and racist criminal justice and immigration system that locks up four times as many people as communist China and leaves millions here at home living in fear.\n\n&gt;But it is not just the ideological debate we are winning.\n\n&gt;We are winning the generational debate as well.\n\n&gt;While Joe Biden does well with older Americans, especially those over 65 years old, our campaign continues to win a vast majority of younger people in this country.\n\n&gt;But while we are winning \u2014 very clearly \u2014 the ideological debate, we are losing, right now, the electability debate.\n\n&gt;I cannot tell you how many people I and our campaign have spoken to that tell me that they like what our campaign stands for but they are going to vote for Joe Biden because they believe he is the best candidate to beat Trump.\n\n&gt;Needless to say, I strongly disagree.\n\n&gt;So, on Sunday, I very much look forward to debating Joe Biden about these issues in Arizona. This will be the first 1-on-1 debate of this campaign, and I am eager for the American people to see which candidate \u2014 which agenda \u2014 is best positioned to defeat Donald Trump, the most dangerous president in modern American history.\n\nBernard represents what people of all races and gender identities want.

to limit the economic and financial fallout, the RBA will provide big lenders with $90 billion of super-cheap money for loans to struggling small and medium enterprises (SMEs).\n\nThe RBA will also drive down the cost of bonds used to fund loans as part of a plan that sees the nation\u2019s benchmark interest rate slashed to the lowest level possible.\n\nMeanwhile the federal government will

credit, especially to businesses\u00ad\u201d.\n\nThere was an immediate response to the moves, with the nation\u2019s biggest bank, [CBA, cutting 1 per cent from business borrowing

was an attempt to bolster millions of households\u2019 cashflow, it will instead automatically reduce all variable rate customers\u2019 repayments to the minimum.\n\nThat will release $3.6 billion, CBA said.\n\nAfter the RBA yesterday reduced its cash rate from 0.5 per cent to the lowest possible level of 0.25 per cent, Governor Philip Lowe said there would be no increase for at least three

On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....\n\nGiven the patient\u2019s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC \u201cpersons under investigation\u201d case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.\nOn January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient\u2019s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.\n\nOn admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.\n\n\nOn days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient\u2019s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.\n\nTreatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.\n\n\nA chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient\u2019s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.\n\n\nOn hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient\u2019s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nOn hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient\u2019s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. \n\nAs of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.\n\n(The above referenced patient survived and was released from hospital and \u201cremains isolated at home.\u201d) see;\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2020-02-04/first-us-coronavirus-patient-released-from-hospital%3fcontext=amp", "subreddit": "China_Flu", "created_utc": 1581141082, "author": "arewebeingplutoed", "link_id": "t3_eyabrj", "parent_id": "t3_eyabrj", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": true, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fk15qw0": {"body": "All the turmoil you are witnessing is coordinated action IMO.

China makes it a common practice to detain U.S. Citizens, without any proof of their accusations. \n\nHe is the longest detained American Citizen in China, without being sentenced or sent to prison! \nWhy? \nBecause they know he is innocent, like many others do, and they have kept him as a pawn for leverage over the  U.S. Trade Negotiations and South China Sea. \n\nGoogle Mark Swidan, and read the credible and fact checked articles from Newsweek and duihua.org. \n\n\nThere is no evidence and met the men, actually involved with the drug trafficking, through a \"friend\" in Houston, TX. This \"friend\" knew he was going to China, and so kindly made the introduction to an \"interpreter\" and \"driver\". This \"friend\" is involved with the drug trafficking as well. \n\nThere is proof he was there for business purposes, which the Chinese High Court won't allow into evidence. \nMark Swidan had  nothing to do with this, and had zero knowledge of anything drug related. \n\n\nHe's been starved, tortured, shackled, beaten, has slept on a cold concrete floor, and used for slave labor for over 7 years. All detainees or prisoners, in China, are forced to make the plastic flowers and Christmas ornaments that WE ALL BUY from Walmart and Hobby Lobby! \n\nWhat would you do if this happened to your son, daughter, mother, father, friend, husband, wife, or you?!?!?!\n\nHelp a fellow U.S. Citizen, with no criminal background, come home! Write to the State Department and Senators, especially TX Senators, and demand they take action to bring him home. \n\nPresident Trump did it for NCAA basketball players, who were actually guilty of breaking the law, but he hasn't done anything for Mark Swidan. \n\nGreat sound bites, from Sec of State and other U.S. government officials, criticizing China for their lack of Human Rights and Due Process, but NO ACTION! \n\n\nNow, there's the Corona Virus outbreak, right around the area he is being detained. China detains anyone, for whatever reason. Don't forget, they are a dictatorship and communist country. He could catch this, and they would just let him die! \n\nHelp Mark Swidan come back home to Houston, TX, and allow this innocent man the ability to start a life again, after much needed healthcare, PTSD care, dental care, sleep on a real bed, and a real meal, without dog meat. \n\nMy name is Lina Lou, and I know he is innocent. I bet my own life on it, and I truly mean it 1000%. \n\nOnly our government can get him home. \n\nOnly U.S. Citizens can make them do it, especially during this 2020 election year. \n\n#freemarkswidan\n#markswidan\n#senatortedcruz\n#cecc\n#wgad\n#presidenttrump\n#trump", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "created_utc": 1580005357, "author": "LeadClickzHouston", "link_id": "t3_et6wi3", "parent_id": "t3_et6wi3", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": true, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fk93urp": {"body": "Apparently my little brothers charter school in SF has had a parent making contact with someone positive.

All decisions made at TECA are in alignment with the guidance provided from CDC, CDPH, SFDPH, and CDE.  \n\n \n\nYesterday, we informed you that a family had been exposed to a person who tested positive for COVID-19. Many questions came to us regarding the grade levels the children are in, whether they were in school when they were exposed to the person, whether they have tested positive for COVID-19, and whether there is an outbreak on campus. \n\n \n\nTo answer your questions, the children are in grades K, 2nd and 8th. The children were here last week. The parent did not know there was any possible exposure last week. The parent contacted the school Monday and did not send the children to school.  Administrators verified information with the family and consulted with SFDPH to identify next steps based on their recommendations. The family was advised to quarantine themselves for 14 days. The parent has contacted their medical provider and is monitoring any occurrence of symptoms. No one in the family shows symptoms of COVID-19. They have not tested positive for COVID-19. The parent will contact the principal immediately if any conditions change and confirms daily that family members are showing no symptoms.  No, there is not an outbreak of COVID-19 at TECA and no one on site has tested positive for COVID-19. \n\n \n\nGUIDANCE FOR SCHOOLS\n\nI. From the SF Public Department of Health\n\n \n\nIf there is a confirmed case of COVID-19 at a school, SFDPH will work with the school to determine the best measures including potential school closure. In addition, SFDPH recommends for schools. \n\n \n\nDo not go to school if sick. Any student or staff member who is sick should not report to school. Any students who appear sick, we are calling families to pick up their children immediately. \n\nIf you have a child with chronic health conditions, consult your doctor about school attendance. If your child has a respiratory condition or any other health issues, you need to contact your medical provider to take the necessary precautions if your child has been in any public place (school, stores, movie theaters, parks, public transportation, etc.) and consider keeping them at home. \n\n Equip all schools and classrooms with hand sanitizers and tissues. All classrooms have been equipped with hand sanitizer, tissue, disinfectant wipes, disinfectant spray, and soap. In addition, our custodial staff are taking extensive measures to disinfect school facilities on a daily (and hourly if necessary) basis according to the CDC guidance.\n\nRecommend rescheduling or cancelling medium to large events that are not essential. All non-essential events have been canceled small, medium, and large.\n\nExplore remote teaching and online options to continue learning. The teachers at TECA are in the process of providing packets and online options for continued learning. Please contact your child\u2019s teacher for specifics.\n\nSchools should develop a plan for citywide school closures, and families should prepare for potential closures.  We are constantly monitoring the health status of students, staff, and families; and monitoring updated guidelines provided by SFDPH, CDPH, and CDE. \n\n \n\nII.        From the California Department of Public Health and California Department of \n\n            Education\n\n \n\nMany of you are asking why aren\u2019t we closing the school. On March 7, 2020, the CDPH and CDE sent guidance on COVID-19. \u201cIf one student, teacher or staff member tests positive for COVID-19 and exposed other at the school, CDPH recommends\u2026in consultation with the local public health department, the appropriate school official may consider if school closure is warranted and length of time based on the risk level within the specific community as determined by the local public health officer\u201d\n\n \n\nWe are a public charter school and we are following guidelines given to us by the California Department of Education. As of March 7th, if a California public school has closed, it\u2019s more likely they have at least one student, teacher, or staff member test positive for COVID-19. Private and Catholic Schools have their own guidelines and are not subject to those provided by CDE. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nKEEP YOURSELF INFORMED\n\nPlease access any of the following links if you want to understand the guidance schools and school districts are provided. We follow the recommendations of the...\n\n SF Department of Public Health (sfdph.org)\n\nCalifornia Department of Public Health (cdph.ca.gov)\n\nCenter for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov)\n\nCalifornia Department of Education (cde.ca.gov)\n\n \n\nPlease be reminded that we are all in the process of navigating this challenging and scary time, as a result, we all react differently to the uncertainty of COVID-19. We all take this situation seriously and as TECA administration, we must always remain calm. We are here to listen/ understand your concerns and will address your questions, recommendations, and feedback accordingly. \n\n\n \n\nTIMELY INFORMATION\n\nOur goal is to provide families and staff timely information regarding COVID-19 and how it impacts TECA.  In the event we are informed that a student, teacher, or staff member tests positive for COVID-19, we will dismiss school immediately and follow up with next steps via Bright Arrow and Auto-Dial. As soon as we hear information our next steps are to  find out all of the facts and consult with SFPDH. We understand that the uncertainty of COVID-19 causes anxiety, frustration, and panic. However, we all respond differently to uncertainty. Please note that we take this situation seriously and all of us want to feel safe from COVID-19. \n\n \n\nThank you for your support and keeping our community safe. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\n \n\nAnakarita Allen                                                                                  Kevin Ch\u00e1vez\n\nExecutive Director/Superintendent                                                    Principal", "subreddit": "CoronavirusCA", "created_utc": 1583968167, "author": "Ivagor96", "link_id": "t3_fh518o", "parent_id": "t1_fk8xxng", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": true, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fklgmt3": {"body": "Even, the original, unmodified version is clearly just being misread.\n\n&gt;This applies especially if you are staying in a country with poorly developed health services and infrastructure and/or collective infrastructure, such as the USA.\n\nIn logic this would be: Return home if: (the country has poorly developed health services and infrastructure) OR (the country has poorly developed collective infrastructure).\n\nAnd we have to dig into \"collective infrastructure\" which, to Norwegians, mostly means public transit.\n\nIf you go read the same University's website, the re-written version confirms this reading:\n\n&gt;This applies especially if you are staying in a country with poorly developed health services.

Despite sharing a border of 3,488 kilometres with China, India has only reported 78 cases and 1 death- compare that with 596 cases and 8 deaths in the UK.\n\n2. India is the only country in the world to evacuate its citizens 6 times (and counting) and evacuated the most number of foreign nationals. \n\n3. The Indian Air Force evacuated a total of 723 Indians, 37 foreign nationals from Wuhan. India evacuated 119 Indians and 5 foreign nationals from Japan. IAF also evacuated 58 Indian pilgrims from Iran on the 10th of March. Total: 900 Indians and 48 foreign nationals.\n\n4. India is leading the fight against COVID-19 in the South Asian region, offering diplomatic, humanitarian and medical assistance to its neighbours.\n\n5. A total of 56 Virus Research Diagnostic Laboratories (VRDLs) have been set up in India to test its citizens as well as foreign citizens in a record time, with a plan to build 56 more VRDLs in the next month. This insane level of efficiency hasn't caught the eye of the media.\n\n6. India currently has one of the world\u2019s most efficient and reliable testing systems, reducing the time taken to get test results back from 12-14 hours to four hours. US health officials have admitted that their system is failing and has testing has been very sluggish.\n\n7. As a result, from Iran, Afghanistan up to Timor Leste, countries in Asia have been requesting India to help set up testing facilities in their countries.\n\n8. India has sent 6 top scientists to set up a make-shift lab and testing facility in Iran to test 6000 of its citizens because Iranian officials refused to test Indians due to their high load. India plans to send 3 more airplanes in the next week to airlift its citizens.\n\n9. India has provided 15 tonnes of medical assistance comprising masks, gloves and other emergency medical equipment to China.\n\n10. India has sent Maldives a 14 member medical team comprising of pulmonologists, anaesthetists, physicians &amp; lab technicians and also a large composite of COVID-19 medical relief to assist Maldives health authorities.\n\n11. India has screened 1,057,506 people from 30 airports and 77 seaports.\n\n12. India has suspended all visas to India as well as visa-free travel facility for OCI cardholders. It has closed its border with Myanmar. The Indian nationals coming from COVID-19 hit nations after 15 February will be quarantined for 14 days. This in contrast with the UK with far more cases but no quick action whatsoever.\n\n13. India has the world\u2019s biggest state-sponsored health assurance scheme, covering over 500 million beneficiaries (approximately 8 times the size of the UK).\n\n14. Indian drug prices are among the cheapest in the world. Medbelle ranks India as one of the five countries with the lowest median prices for drugs around the world due to an elaborate price control mechanism for drugs and the government\u2019s Jan Aushadi project to provide cheap affordable medicines to the poor.\n\n15. China had silenced the doctor who identified COVID-19 and he died 6 weeks later. China let this brew. On the other hand, when Nipah virus was found in India in 2018, 3 doctors identified it and authorities immediately reported it to WHO. 2000 quarantined and 17 died in total.\nIndia would have NEVER allowed it to become a pandemic.\n\nThe Indian civilization, being one of the most advanced in the world, has been way ahead of its time with gifting the world the Namaste- which is now propagated by every world leader.

Her fever had subsided after a few days, and she began to breathe more easily after being attached to a ventilator.\n\nHer spirits lifted. On Jan. 25, she told her colleagues she was recovering.\n\n\u201c\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa I will return to the team soon,\u201d she texted them on WeChat.\n\n\u201cWe need you the most,\u201d one of her colleagues responded.\n\nIn early February, Dr. Xia asked her husband, Wu Shilei, also a doctor, whether he thought she could get off oxygen therapy soon.\n\n\u201cTake it easy. Don\u2019t be too anxious,\u201d he replied on WeChat. He told her that the ventilator could possibly be removed by the following week.\n\n\u201cI keep on thinking about getting better soon,\u201d Dr. Xia responded.\n\nThere was reason to believe she was on the mend. After all, most coronavirus patients recover.\n\nLater, Dr. Xia tested negative twice for the coronavirus. She told her mother she expected to be discharged on Feb. 8.\n\nDecline\nDay 4 to 16 after hospitalization\n\n\n\n In the hospital, Ms. Deng\u2019s only contacts were her roommate and the medical staff. She added a caption to a photo with her doctor, saying laughter would help chase the illness away. Two tests indicated that Dr. Xia was free of the virus, but her condition suddenly deteriorated.\n\nBy Ms. Deng\u2019s fourth day in the hospital, she could no longer pretend to be cheerful. She was vomiting, having diarrhea and relentlessly shivering.\n\nHer fever jumped to 101.3 degrees. Early in the morning on Feb. 5, she woke from a fitful sleep to find the medicine had done nothing to lower her temperature. She cried. She said she was classified as critically ill.\n\nThe next day, she threw up three times, until she was left spitting white bubbles. She felt she was hallucinating. She could not smell or taste, and her heart rate slowed to about 50 beats per minute.\n\nOn a phone call, Ms. Deng\u2019s mother tried to reassure her that she was young and otherwise healthy, and that the virus would pass like a bad cold. But Ms. Deng feared otherwise. \u201cI felt like I was walking on the edge of death,\u201d she wrote in a social media post from her hospital bed the next day.\n\nChina defines a critically ill patient as someone with respiratory failure, shock or organ failure. Around 5 percent of infected patients became critical in China, according to one of the largest studies to date of coronavirus cases. Of those, 49 percent died. (Those rates may eventually change once more cases are examined around the world.)\n\nWhile Dr. Xia appeared to be recovering, she was still terrified of dying. Testing can be faulty, and negative results don\u2019t necessarily mean patients are in the clear.\n\nShe asked her mother for a promise: Could her parents look after her 2-year-old son if she didn\u2019t make it?\n\nHoping to dispel her anxiety with humor, her mother, Jiang Wenyan, chided her: \u201cHe\u2019s your own son. Don\u2019t you want to raise him yourself?\u201d\n\nDr. Xia also worried about her husband. Over video chat, she urged him to put on protective equipment at the hospital where he worked. \u201cShe said she would wait for me to return safely,\u201d he said, \u201cand go to the frontline again with me when she recovered.\u201d\n\nThen came the call. Dr. Xia\u2019s condition had suddenly deteriorated. In the early hours of Feb. 7, her husband rushed to the emergency room.\n\nHer heart had stopped.\n\nRecovery\nDay 17 after hospitalization\n\n\nAfter being discharged, Ms. Deng briefly got to see her mother, who had been working at the hospital during her illness. She then went home to isolate herself for two weeks.\nIn most cases, the body repairs itself. The immune system produces enough antibodies to clear the virus, and the patient recovers.\n\nBy the end of Ms. Deng\u2019s first week in the hospital, her fever had receded. She could eat the food her mother delivered. On Feb. 10, as her appetite returned, she looked up photos of meat skewers online and posted them wishfully to social media.\n\nOn Feb. 15, her throat swab came back negative for the virus. Three days later, she tested negative again. She could go home.\n\nMs. Deng met her mother briefly at the hospital\u2019s entrance. Then, because Wuhan remained locked down, without taxis or public transportation, she walked home alone.\n\n\u201cI felt like a little bird,\u201d she recalled. \u201cMy freedom had been returned to me.\u201d\n\nShe had to isolate at home for 14 days. Her husband and daughter stayed with her parents.\n\nAt home, she threw out her clothing, which she had been wearing for her entire time in the hospital.\n\nSince then, she has passed the time by playing with her cats and watching television. She jokes that she is getting an early taste of retirement. She does daily deep breathing exercises to strengthen her lungs, and her cough has faded.\n\nThe Chinese government has urged recovered patients to donate plasma, which experts say contains antibodies that could be used to treat the sick. Ms. Deng contacted a local blood bank soon after getting home.\n\nShe plans to go back to work as soon as the hospital allows it.\n\n\u201cIt was the nation that saved me,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think I can pay it back to the nation.\u201d\n\nDeath\nDay 35 after hospitalization\n\n\nOn Dr. Xia\u2019s desk at work, her colleagues left 1,000 paper cranes \u2014 a Chinese symbol of hope and blessings. Written on the wings was a message: \u201cRest in peace, we will use our lives to continue this relay race and prevail over this epidemic.\u201d\nIt was sometime after 3 a.m. on Feb. 7 when Dr. Xia was rushed to intensive care. Doctors first intubated her. Then, the president of the hospital frantically summoned several experts from around the city, including Dr. Peng Zhiyong, head of the department of critical care at Zhongnan Hospital.\n\nThey called every major hospital in Wuhan to borrow an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or Ecmo, machine to do the work of her heart and lungs.\n\nDr. Xia\u2019s heart started beating again. But the infection in her lungs was too severe, and they failed. Her brain was starved of oxygen, causing irreversible damage. Soon, her kidneys shut down and doctors had to put her on round-the-clock dialysis.\n\n\u201cThe brain acts as the control center,\u201d Dr. Peng said. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t command her other organs, so those organs would fail. It was only a matter of time.\u201d\n\nDr. Xia slipped into a coma. She died on Feb. 23.\n\nDr. Peng remains baffled about why Dr. Xia died after she had seemed to improve. Her immune system, like that of many health workers, may have been compromised by constant exposure to sickness. Perhaps she suffered from what experts call a \u201ccytokine storm,\u201d in which the immune system\u2019s reaction to a new virus engulfs the lungs with white blood cells and fluid. Perhaps she died because her organs were starved of oxygen.\n\nBack at Dr. Xia\u2019s home, her son, Jiabao \u2014 which means priceless treasure \u2014 still thinks his mother is working. When the phone rings, he tries to grab it from his grandmother\u2019s hands, shouting: \u201cMama, mama.\u201d\n\nHer husband, Dr. Wu, doesn\u2019t know what to tell Jiabao.

It was scheduled to be a two-week cruise, but with that period running out this week, there had been worries about fuel and food supplies. Many on board are elderly and there was also concerns they could be running out of medicines.\nTo kill time and break up the monotony of endless ocean scrolling past cabin windows, the ship\u2019s crew have organised dozens of activities to keep people occupied, tourists on board the vessel told Reuters.\n\nPeople could be seen playing chess and doing puzzles on Wednesday, in some of the first pictures published by media of life aboard the ship.\nOther activities on offer included colouring-in for adults; teeth whitening; poker tournaments; whisky tasting; even a lecture on modern China which delved into the economics of collective farming, according to passengers on board and a copy of the ship\u2019s activity programme seen by Reuters.\nPassengers on board the ship have been subjected to regular health checks, according to Holland America, the ship operator and a unit of Miami-based Carnival Corp. There have been no reported cases of the coronavirus on board.\n\nStoking fears of authorities in countries on the ship\u2019s route has been the ongoing quarantine in Japan of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, also managed by a unit of Carnival Corp. A total of 175 out of the 3,700 people on board the Diamond Princess have tested positive for the coronavirus.\nLate on Wednesday, the Westerdam changed its course away from Bangkok and began heading towards Cambodia, according to data published by the Marine Traffic ship tracking website.\n\nEarlier, the Thai Navy \u201cBhumibol Adulyadej\u201d warship could be seen escorting the Westerdam in waters just off the Thai coast, according to passengers and Marine Traffic.\nDespite the uncertainty, crew members had staged a farewell ceremony for passengers on Wednesday morning, singing to the tune of the 1979 hit \u201cWe Are Family\u201d by Sister Sledge.\n\nElsewhere on board, the patience of some passengers has been tested by the prolonged uncertainty, Jones said, as some people pushed and shoved for access to one of the ship\u2019s only available computers and printers, to re-book flights home.\n\u201cHard to imagine these senior cruisers coming to blows but guess that happened,\u201d said Jones. \u201cIt\u2019s funny and sad at the same time\u201d.

This test(assay) that the cdc developed targets 3 different regions of the 2019-nCoV genome.  The Coronavirus has a RNA genome (like influenza and other respiratory viruses).  \n\nThe viral RNA is extracted from upper or lower respiratory specimens like nasal/throat swabs or sputum.  An enzyme called reverse transcriptase is used to transcribe the 3 targeted regions of the Coronavirus from RNA in to DNA.  \n\nThen PCR is performed on the resulting complementary DNA.  PCR is using an enzyme called Taq Polymerase and short strands of synthetic DNA called primers and probes to amplify the DNA.  The probes contain a fluorescent molecule that gets released when the DNA is replicated.  When it is released, it fluoresces, and that image is capture by a camera on the instrument.\n\nA real-time PCR instrument is basically an oven that can heat up/cool down quickly, with a light source to excite the fluorescent molecule and a camera to detect the emission.  Both reverse transcription and PCR are temperature sensitive reactions hence the oven component of the instrument.  \n\nOnce there have been enough copies of DNA amplified the fluorescent signal generated from the probes is intense enough to cross a threshold setting.  If the signal for all 3 targets of the Coronavirus genome crosses the threshold, then a patient is considered positive for the virus.  \n\nPCR is an exponential reaction, making it very sensitive and able to detect just a few copies of a viruses genome.  This is the same method used for CDC\u2019s influenza surveillance (but the reagents are different).  \n\nA big hurdle with getting the cdc\u2019s assay in to labs across the United Sates is the time required to design the assay, order reagents for it, verify the assay, manufacture test kits, and get approval from the FDA for an emergency use authorization (EUA).  An EUA is basically allowing the use of this test without it being FDA validated.  FDA validation is a multi year process so an EUA is issued for emergent public health issues.\n\n[The CDC has their protocol on their website:](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/rt-pcr-detection-instructions.html) \n\nCosts for running this test is similar to what it costs for testing flu.

WHO, who has looked at this virus most intensively, who has looked extremely closely at the experience in China, who has looked at the mortality rates in China, and has tried to estimate whether there\u2019s a lot of undercounting in China, does not feel like we\u2019re seeing the tip of the iceberg, as Bruce who led that expedition said we\u2019re seeing the pyramid, actually. They think the mortality rate is higher than 1%, which, even if it were 1%, would be 10x deadlier than the average rate of your seasonal flu, and because this is a virus that is now circulating in a population that has absolutely no immunity to it, you would expect the attack rates to be much higher than the attack rates that we normally see with the seasonal flu. You might have an attack rate that\u2019s 3x higher than seasonal flu with a mortality rate that\u2019s at least 10x higher. The most concerning thing about this virus is the combination of infectiousness and the ability to cause severe disease or death. We have not since 1918, the Spanish flu, seen a virus that combined those two qualities in the same way. We have seen very lethal viruses; but those viruses have high mortality rates. Ebola\u2019s mortality rate in some settings is greater than 80%, but they don\u2019t have the infectiousness that this virus has. They don\u2019t have the potential to explode and spread globally. I don\u2019t want to make predictions, because I think what happens with this virus is up to us. I do think this virus has the potential to cause a global pandemic if we\u2019re not already there, and I do think the virus has demonstrated that it has a lethality that is likely many fold higher than normal flu. In some respects, if it\u2019s between 1% and 3.4% it really doesn\u2019t matter what\u2019s after the decimal point. I think what we\u2019re seeing is a virus that is many many times more lethal than flu, in right now a population that\u2019s completely vulnerable to it and that we\u2019re seeing it\u2019s ability to explode.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne challenge that we face is that people who are young and generally healthy won\u2019t perceive (social) risk and they\u2019ll govern their behavior based on what they perceive their personal risk to be. I think we need to start thinking in terms of the social risk. I\u2019m generally healthy, I\u2019m not that concerned about my own personal risk, but if I then felt well enough to go to work and I go to work and I shake hands with my older colleague who\u2019s got a chronic medical condition, I could be responsible for that colleague\u2019s death. I think we all need to think about our responsibility to each other as we think about how we\u2019re going to govern our behavior. We can\u2019t view the epidemic in terms of our personal risk, we need to act collectively in a cooperative manner. One of the things that Bruce has talked about from the WHO coming back from the investigation in China is the degree to which the Chinese people have been mobilized against the virus. He put it in terms of it is like they are at war with the virus, all of society is mobilized in the fight against the virus.\u201d", "subreddit": "CoronavirusUS", "created_utc": 1583531945, "author": "Droopyworm", "link_id": "t3_fel0gq", "parent_id": "t3_fel0gq", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": true, "pessimism": true, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fkyu66p": {"body": "You're doing a weird attempt at psychologizing the conversation.

Once it infects a cell, it will eject its babies which spread interstitially, and are picked up by the lymph system, and spread to lymph nodes.  Also, the virus can infect any type of epithelium, including blood vessels.  In other words, no matter where you start it growing, it eventually spreads throughout the body.  This is why SARS-COV-2 is not just pneumogenic, but can also cause sepsis.\n\nThe only practical way of inoculating against it would be to have damaged versions, such as if you had a vat of it, lysed them all, destroyed the rna, and separated out the protein coat fragments, then injected those.  They would still bind, and cause a local reaction, which would be detected, and trigger an immune response; however, they would not be able to replicate, since there would be no mRNA.  It might take several inoculations to confer immunity.\n\nI think the current proto-vaccine includes viral fragments that encode only for the spike, that have been synthesized.  They are first testing to make sure people don't have some horrible side effect from the new vaccine, and then they will test to see if people actually get immunity from it.  Once that's done, they'll work on mass producing it.\n\nAnother thing being thrown around is blood serum.  People with immunity will contain reminder tags in the blood, which remind the immune system how to react to this virus if it happens again.  Those reminders can be used to pre-warn other peoples' immune systems in some cases.  That's still yet to be tested here.\n\nThere may be other types of inoculations that confer immunity, but full power, live virus, anywhere in the body, would not be the way to go.\n\nBelow, I've linked to a photo showing one cell, and the small circles around the outside of this area, and around the vacuoles seen budding off of that cell, are corona virus particles.

Such authority had not been used since a smallpox outbreak in 1969. But officials had to find some way to make sure the passengers did not leave the base until it was clear they were not infected.\n\n&gt;Mr. Azar pushed for the order but others were wary, concerned it could cause panic. They decided to ask the passengers to voluntarily stay at the military base. One woman balked, so California officials, who use quarantine authority more often, stepped in and forced the passengers to stay.\n\n&gt;Time to Provoke China?\n\n&gt;By the end of January, the virus was veering out of control in China, the source of 23,000 visitors to the United States each day. Any one of them could be the trigger for a new and undetected American outbreak.\n\n&gt;Over four days in the White House Situation Room, the nation\u2019s top public health and national security officials engaged in a fierce debate over whether to take the extraordinary step of banning travel from China.\n\n&gt;Public health officials were initially wary. Experts have long recommended against restricting travel during outbreaks, arguing that it is often ineffective and can stymie the response by limiting the movements of doctors and other health professionals trying to contain the disease. A ban would anger China, they worried, ending any hope of cooperation with American medical teams.\n\n&gt;Officials at the National Security Council and Department of Homeland Security argued that China had already proved unwilling to cooperate. A third group inside the White House was worried that the move would incite panic and could roil the financial markets.\n\n&gt;By Thursday, Jan. 30, the public health officials had come around. Mr. Azar, Dr. Redfield and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed that a ban on travel from the epidemic\u2019s center could buy some time to put into place prevention and testing measures. \u201cThere was so much we didn\u2019t know about this virus,\u201d Dr. Redfield said in an interview. \u201cWe were rapidly understanding it was much more transmissible, that it had a great ability to go global.\u201d\n\n&gt;The debate moved that afternoon to the Oval Office, where Mr. Azar and others urged the president to approve the ban. \u201cThe situation has changed radically,\u201d Mr. Azar told Mr. Trump.\n\n&gt;Others in the room urged being more cautious, arguing that a ban could have unforeseen consequences. \u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d warned Kellyanne Conway, the president\u2019s counselor. Mr. Trump was skeptical, though he would later claim that everyone around him had been against the idea. The two countries were in delicate trade negotiations. Was this the time to provoke China? he asked. And what about the consequences on the economy?\n\n&gt;The president sided with his more aggressive aides, and announced the ban next day.\n\n&gt;Still, Mr. Trump was publicly upbeat about the effects of the virus. At a campaign rally in New Hampshire in early February, as the World Health Organization was announcing new cases by the tens of thousands, he said of the coronavirus, \u201cBy April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away.\u201d\n\n&gt;In fact, the fight against the virus was already beginning to stumble.\n\n&gt;A system used to track travelers returning from China went offline just as state officials were told to begin monitoring them. Mr. Azar said at a congressional hearing that he needed at least 300 million respirator masks for health care workers, but the national emergency stockpile, the government\u2019s reserve of disaster supplies, held only 12 million, and many of those had expired.\n\n&gt;And a C.D.C. coronavirus test distributed to state labs had a flawed component that led to sometimes inconclusive results, crippling the nation\u2019s testing capacity for weeks, despite assurances by the administration that it was quickly being resolved.\n\n&gt;Americans stranded in Japan on a cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, were finally returned home Feb. 17, but the president became enraged when he learned that 14 of the passengers had tested positive for the virus in the process of being transferred to government planes.\n\n&gt;He later said that he was worried that bringing back people who tested positive for the virus would increase the public tally of people infected in the United States.\n\n&gt;The month ended with a whistle-blower\u2019s claim that workers from the Department of Health and Human Services had been sent to greet returning Americans from China at two military bases in California without the personal protective gear that is required for anyone coming into contact with potentially exposed patients. None of the workers tested positive for the virus, but the allegation shook Congress.\n\n&gt;\u2018I Like the Numbers Being Where They Are.\u2019\n\n&gt;The president\u2019s motorcade pulled onto the main C.D.C. campus in Atlanta just before 4:30 p.m. on Friday, passing protesters holding signs that said \u201cHave faith in science\u201d and \u201cWe need a vaccine against Trump.\u201d\n\n&gt;Ten weeks after the virus first emerged in China, the total number of confirmed cases in the world surged past 100,000 and public health experts warned darkly that the outbreak was far from over. The United States, they said, faces weeks, if not months, of uncertainty and continued disruptions in education, businesses, commerce, medicine, government and daily life.\n\n&gt;\u201cTime matters,\u201d Dr. Redfield said in an interview on Friday.\n\n&gt;Last week, Vice President Mike Pence was given control of the public messaging, and although Mr. Pence has had some mixed messages of his own \u2014 he promised more tests before they were available \u2014 the White House has since displayed more discipline. Mr. Pence holds twice daily conference calls with officials from across the country, and a virus task force he leads issues daily talking points, with comment from the health professionals, to make sure the message is consistent.\n\n&gt;But the president still has his bullhorn. During his visit to the C.D.C., Mr. Trump told reporters that he was not inclined to let 21 people who tested positive for the virus on a cruise ship off the coast of California onto American soil.\n\n&gt;\u201cThey would like to have the people come off,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to have the people stay.\u201d The president said he would allow health experts to make the final decision, but he made clear again where he stood.\n\n&gt;His concern? It would increase the tally for the number of people infected in the United States. \u201cBecause I like the numbers being where they are,\u201d the president said.\n\n&gt;Michael D.

Nobody has a problem with it. Then instantly it was called Corona virus overnight.  What caused this shift?\n\nIt was called a coronavirus all along. What changed is that the outbreak got an official name, Covid-19. This article goes into the various factors that go into picking the official name.\n\n&gt;The fact that it took weeks for global health officials to settle on what to call an illness that has already [**infected more than 64,000 people and killed more than 1,300**](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) shows just how fraught the naming process can be.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cWe had to find a name that did not refer to a geographical location, an animal, an individual, or a group of people, and which is also pronounceable and related to the disease,\u201d said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO, during a press conference this week.\n\n[https://www.vox.com/2020/2/14/21135208/coronavirus-wuhan-china-covid-19-name-sars-cov-2](https://www.vox.com/2020/2/14/21135208/coronavirus-wuhan-china-covid-19-name-sars-cov-2)\n\nWhy not call it a Wuhan virus? Because it isn't in Wuhan anymore. It's everywhere. Tying it to a single location fuels widespread discrimination against people with the most superficial connections to that location, like having Asian features. That discrimination doesn't only impact thousands of completely innocent people. It also gets in the way of addressing the real reasons for the spread of the disease, which leads to more deaths and illnesses.\n\n [https://www.npr.org/2020/03/02/811363404/when-xenophobia-spreads-like-a-virus](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/02/811363404/when-xenophobia-spreads-like-a-virus)\n\n[https://abcnews.go.com/US/backlash-asians-hinder-efforts-coronavirus-expert/story?id=69556008](https://abcnews.go.com/US/backlash-asians-hinder-efforts-coronavirus-expert/story?id=69556008)\n\n[https://time.com/5797836/coronavirus-racism-stereotypes-attacks/](https://time.com/5797836/coronavirus-racism-stereotypes-attacks/)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia\\_and\\_racism\\_related\\_to\\_the\\_2019\u201320\\_coronavirus\\_pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia_and_racism_related_to_the_2019\u201320_coronavirus_pandemic)\n\nAdditionally, tying the disease to a particular location gives people false hope that they aren't as susceptible to the disease as long as they avoid contact with the original infected population. AIDS was dismissed as \"gay disease\" for decades before finally getting treated as a universal health crisis. In some parts of the world, leaders continue to use the original stigma to reject the most basic measures that would bring AIDS under control.\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/reducing-stigma.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/reducing-stigma.html)\n\n [https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/23074/](https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/23074/)\n\nSure China doesn't want people associating the disease with its handling of the outbreak. But that's not going to change where the disease goes next. Trump's total failure to prepare or react in time have far more to do with its spread in the US than anything China did. Imagine if China hadn't conducted any quarantine at all instead of their massive lockdown. The rest of the world would have been hit that much harder. What does obsessing over the origin point contribute toward fighting the disease? The millions of people in Wuhan didn't all create the disease, pick their government, or live all their lives differently than the rest of humanity for the outbreak to hit them before everyone else. The disease originated near them. It didn't stay put for long.\n\nProfessionals made all these points to news organizations. The news organizations adapted to the new information and switched their terminology. No conspiracy, no clickbait motives. Whereas right-wing propaganda outlets go out of their way to pretend it's all part of a liberal campaign to whitewash China's crimes or something along those lines.

After all, the etiologic agents responsible for the pandemics were not identified until years after the epidemic peaked, and effective vaccination or drug treatment was not even remotely possible in real-time.  In the AIDS pandemic, the etiologic agent was not identified until 3-years after the start of the pandemic, a diagnostic test was not developed until 4-years later and effective pharmacological management (HAART) was not in place until a decade later.\n\nTimes have changed with advancing technology. **COVID-19 was identified, sequenced and a diagnostic test was developed and implemented within a matter of weeks following the start of the epidemic.** This raises the possibility that effective drug(s) treatment may become available on a much faster timeline than has previously been possible. Indeed, there are a number of promising lead candidate drugs  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4136000/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4136000/)  and the SARSCoV drug remdesivir is currently in Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of COBID-19. What this means is that keeping as many people free from infection for as long as possible is a reasonable strategy in an era where automated combinatorial chemistry, drug screening and intelligent design of therapeutic molecules have become a reality. These and other developments offer the very real possibility that an effective therapeutic drug(s) may be developed and deployed in a matter of months, rather than in a matter of years. \n\nRegardless of what the pubic health bureaucrats and government decide on the basis of economic or political considerations, my advice to you is simple: stay infection free and alive as long as possible.", "subreddit": "COVID19", "created_utc": 1581497755, "author": "Michael-G-Darwin", "link_id": "t3_f2idjv", "parent_id": "t1_fhcrucj", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": true, "pessimism": true, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fl4wc0y": {"body": "We're legally mandated to follow social distancing here, enforced by the military.

US population, city size, and living situations. So China's population is roughly 4 times that of the United States, 1.4 billion compared to 325 million. Wuhan is a city of 11 million, for contrast the largest city in the US, New York is only 8.6 million. What this all means is that people in China live much closer together. They take more public transportation and they share more sanitary facilities than is common in the US. Google Chinese bathrooms and understand that it is common for them to be shared. That means the virus is much easier to spread, especially before people are aware of it. If everyone is crammed into subway cars, and sharing bathrooms you are more likely to catch it than if you are commuting to work alone in your car. So with that in mind, I dont think the US or Europe will take any more extreme measure than to say wash your hands frequently, avoid touching your face, and stay home if you are sick. These are effective measures to prevent the transmission. \nBut to the extreme, the federal government at ready.org lists how to prepare for a pandemic and the preparation is essentially stockpile essentials for 2 weeks. Its really hard to spread a virus if everyone is in their homes. I don't think that will happen in the US because we seem to have a responsive system in the CDC, as much as people will put them down in this sub. I do think it is likely the US will extend the travel ban on China but I think that might involve Global economics more than anyone will like to admit. Canada is still allowing Chinese citizens in and we are not seeing an epidemic there. Furthermore Trump's entire election strategy is the current stock market. Any quarantine or outbreak will hurt that number so I think every measure will take place to prevent that.\n Also in terms of transminssion, the Chicago resident who contracted the virus from his wife and then traveled to different job sites. So far there has not been reported additional cases off of that and I will guarantee that those people are all being closely monitored. The number of reported cases we are seeing now in China, especially in Hubei I believe are transmission within close family units. If a person gets it, and then gives it to their close family members that will burn itself out when there are no more members of their family to give it to. Daily percentage increase of infected is down to roughly 8% in China and seemingly dropping. And even on the the cruise ship with 61 confirmed cases that is only 2% of the total passengers. Think about that. In a close quarters situation only 2% of people got it. That seems a lot less transmittable than other sources would make it seem. I think people on this sub and on r/coronavirus are almost rooting for things to get worse, but currently it does seem like Chins has some grasp on the situation. Why because if 2% of all Chinese people get it that's still 28 million people. And with 2% mortality you're talking about half a million dead. That number they will not be able to hide, the market will tank and the CCP will lose its fragile grasp on the country. So before that can happen they will do everything in their power to prevent mass infection. Oh and I get \"their censorship spread the virus\" but what would spread a virus faster than yelling \"plague\" and having infected people run away to all corners of the country. Well there is my rant, it's an optimistic look but I have taken the steps the federal government recommends in preparation in case of a pandemic.

This year, the coronavirus adds a layer of unease to the seasonal annoyance, especially in areas such as Washington, D.C., where pollen counts are already at moderate to high levels. With fear rising in tandem with the number of cases of covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus, doctors worry allergy sufferers will conflate their routine reactions to pollen with coronavirus symptoms and overwhelm an already-strained health care system with panicked visits.\n\n\u201cIt can be confusing, and it\u2019s important to differentiate. If it\u2019s viral, every time you cough, you\u2019re spreading droplets within a six-feet radius\u201d that can infect others, said Sally Joo Bailey, an allergist at Allergy Associates of Northern Virginia in Arlington and the past president of the Greater Washington Asthma, Allergy and Clinical Immunology Society. Allergies, on the other hand, are not contagious.\n\nBecause of warmer temperatures, allergy season started in February this year instead of March, Bailey said, so Washington-area residents are already exhibiting symptoms. Data show that some people infected with the coronavirus experience similar symptoms, such as coughing, nasal congestion, runny nose and sore throat.\nAD\n\nBut there are key differences between the virus and allergies that should help allay unnecessary panic. Allergies, which are an overreaction of the immune system to foreign particles, should not trigger chills, body aches or fevers, Bailey said. Those are the classic signs of a viral infection, such as covid-19. In addition, while patients with coronavirus can have nasal congestion, it is not common. The World Health Organization found that only about 5 percent of the coronavirus patients in China had nasal congestion. About 14 percent had a sore throat.\n\nGovernmental agencies debunk bogus coronavirus cures such as bleach, garlic and silver\n\n Unfortunately, we are still in cold and flu season, which can go on until as late as May, and it is less easy to differentiate between covid-19 and those illnesses. Both cold and the flu, or influenza, are, like covid-19, viral infections transmitted through person-to-person contact. Flu is accompanied by fever, and a cold can cause fever, too. Both the flu and the coronavirus can cause a dry cough. A cold can be accompanied by a wet or dry cough.\n\nThe flu vaccine provides no protection against the coronavirus and does not guarantee you will not get the flu, so people who have been vaccinated against flu but are experiencing flu-like symptoms should take them seriously.\nAD\n\n\u201cIn Virginia and Maryland, flu activity is still high,\u201d said Jesse L. Goodman, an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University. \u201cEven an experienced clinician can\u2019t always tell the difference between viral infections without testing.\u201d\n\nWhen in doubt, it is best to consult a doctor, Goodman said. \u201cThey\u2019ll probably ask about general health and medications to assess your risk group.\u201d Patients with high fever and difficulty breathing will be asked to come in but as cases of covid-19 rise, patients exhibiting mild symptoms may be asked to stay home rather than come in for testing since there is no medication for the disease, only supportive care. \u201cWe have a desire to test for flu because we have a treatment that helps with that,\u201d Goodman said, referring to the antiviral medication used to treat some flu patients.\n\nHere are some suggestions from experts about how to handle this confluence of seasonal allergies, the common cold, influenza and the coronavirus.\nAD\n\nSign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked within the newsletter are free to access.\n\n\u25cf Experienced seasonal allergy sufferers should pay close attention to allergy symptoms they are familiar with and treat them as they normally would. That includes showering and washing your hair as soon as you get home to remove pollen and taking the antihistamine that works best for you. Some antihistamines, such as Benadryl, have sedative effects and work quickly but must be retaken every four to six hours. Others such as Allegra, Claritin and Zyrtec are long-lasting and non-sedating but can require up to several hours to take effect. Antihistamines should provide some relief. If they do not, consult a primary care physician or an allergist.\n\n\u25cf Anyone not feeling well should watch for a fever. Coronavirus can cause high fever, severe cough and shortness of breath. If you have a fever accompanied by difficulty breathing, seek medical help immediately.\n\n\u25cf While is important that healthcare professionals have the space and resources to help those who really need it, feel free to call your doctor\u2019s office with concerns. A nurse can ask questions that will help determine whether you need to be examined immediately. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to flood the system, especially the emergency rooms right now,\u201d said Elizabeth Douglass, an infectious diseases specialist at Dell Seton Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin.\nAD\n\n\u25cf Get a flu shot, if you have not. Flu activity in Maryland and Virginia has been decreasing for the third week in a row but it is still high. The CDC reports that this season\u2019s flu vaccine decreases chances of catching the flu by 45 percent. People who have not gotten the flu vaccine still can and should.\n\n\u25cf Find out whether you are a candidate for the pneumonia vaccine. Both the flu and coronavirus can result in pneumonia, which can be life-threatening. Adults over the age of 65 or others with certain chronic medical conditions may benefit from the vaccine, which provides protection from the most common pneumonia in adults.\n\n\u25cf Wash your hands. This helps prevent the spread of all viral infections, including cold, influenza and the coronavirus. Use soap and warm water, and scrub well.\n\nDon\u2019t just wash your hands to prevent coronavirus. Moisturize them, too.\n\n\u25cf Don\u2019t panic. There is no need to purchase face masks or wear them unless you have a contagious viral infection or you are caring for someone who is.\nAD\n\n \u201cNo one can say right now that this is not significant virus,\u201d Goodman said of the coronavirus. \u201cBut I think it is really important that people realize this is not Ebola,\u201d which has an average case fatality rate of 50 percent, compared with the World Health Organization\u2019s current estimate of between 3 and 4 percent for COVID-19. \u201cIt does appear that the great majority of people have a mild illness and get better.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized that as we enter allergy season and exit cold and flu season, it is important that the public does not rush to the emergency room with seasonal allergies and minor illnesses, or purchase masks and hand sanitizer unnecessarily.\n\n\u201cSometimes fear can be more dangerous than a virus,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople may put themselves and other people in danger.\u201d", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1583882206, "author": "queenmyrcella", "link_id": "t3_fgknbp", "parent_id": "t3_fgknbp", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": true, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": true, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fjoyie4": {"body": "I am living in Germany, a country that has \"free healthcare\" - i.e. it's paid for by taxes off your paycheck. There are pros and cons to public health insurance:\n\nPro:\n\n- I can go to a checkup without paying anything, which makes it easier to recognize diseases early on\n- Employer pays one half of my insurance, I pay the other half. I think that's fair.\n- I don't have to worry about hospital bills, every day in the hospital only costs 10\u20ac.\n- I know of some people that are on private that got teeth removed even though they didn't need to be removed - because the doctor was earning more money per tooth, so doctors prescribe more medicine than necessary. Which usually doesn't happen in a public system since there's no motivation to prescribe more medicine than necessary.\n- With private health insurance, you usually get parts of your money back if you don't use up your insurance on a per-year basis. With public health insurance, you're paying even if you haven't been sick in years and you don't get anything back.\n\nCons:\n\n- Higher taxes, obviously. Nothing is \"free\". I have to pay about 300\u20ac monthly off my paycheck for insurance, but remember: the more income you have, the more you pay. That's 3600\u20ac per year. Private insurance is about 500\u20ac / month, depending on your income it may actually be cheaper than public insurance. I know of people who switched to private because they were paying 900\u20ac in taxes per month.\n- System gets abused by work-shy and lazy people, i.e. \"yeah let me just get a attestation on Monday, I don't want to work today\". Generally the work ethic in Germany is higher than in America, i.e. people who abuse the system get looked down upon, so not that many people do it.\n- You have to wait months / years for basic treatments, even emergencies don't get treated immediately. I got rolled into the hospital with a near-failing kidney, doctor just said \"well it's not bleeding yet, so you can wait another month, we're currently booked out\".\n- Higher bureaucracy and lower quality healthcare. Everything has to be checked \"is this covered by public insurance\" (if not, \"get fucked\") - and if you get a treatment it's guaranteed to be the lowest quality possible (so the state can save its money).\n- Since our govt decided to use those taxes to repay national debt rather than , the healthcare system got stripped to its absolute core. Hospitals in rural areas closed and got centralized into big cities. Now the central hospitals - who are already strapped for cash - are working around the clock to get the waiting lists managed somehow. Need an X-Ray? 2 Months. Need braces? 1 Year. A colleague of mine has private insurance, he got his braces within weeks (but had to pay more, obviously).\n- Many treatments are not covered by public insurance - their attorneys do everything they can in order to still make you pay for your medicine *on top of already high taxes*. I.e. you get fucked in the ass twice.\n\nIt's \"free\" healthcare as long as you're not using it. Once shit actually hits the fan, you'll start to see the cracks in \"free\" healthcare system. I'm not saying full private healthcare is better, but ELIMININATING private insurance is ABSOLUTELY NOT the way to go. It's okay to have a safety net for poor people, but that can be easily turned  into a hammock for lazy people. In Germany we have two systems: private and public. If you have an income above 63k / year, you can opt-out of public insurance. I do think you can have public healthcare without ruining an economy (see NHS in Britain), but not by forbidding private insurance. I do think our system is okay, but it needs a government that actually wants to benefit the people - and my personal opinion of politicians is that no matter how much they say they work \"for the people\", in the end they always try to benefit themselves. Our health minister is an absolute joke, he tried to combat the coronavirus by making people fill out forms instead of producing testing kits. The insane bureaucracy of a centralized health care system is something often forgotten - people laugh about Mike \"just pray it away\" Pence, but in the end it's the same shitshow over here, even with \"affordable\" healthcare.\n\nTLDR: It can work, but there are cons to consider.\n\nAlso, the \"free college\" is retarded. We implemented \"free college\" over here and the end result is that now *everyone* goes to college, even people who shouldn't. And after implementing a \"nobody gets left behind\" policy even your grades don't even matter anymore. This in turn reduced the actual value of a degree - now that everyone has a degree and schools are overcrowded with struggling students, the quality of education has declined and all that has changed is how many years you have to waste in school. The same things that got taught in school in 10 years now take 15 years - we have doctors and lawyers out the ass but we're lacking mechanics, roof tilers and craftsmen.", "subreddit": "worldpolitics", "created_utc": 1583537576, "author": "parabol443", "link_id": "t3_fegafx", "parent_id": "t1_fjnxvra", "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": false, "disgust": true, "fear": false, "joy": true, "love": false, "optimism": true, "pessimism": true, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fjesvxu": {"body": "**With this new coronavirus outbreak, working from home is no longer a privilege, it\u2019s a necessity.**\n\nThe sanitary risk of a 2019-nCoV outbreak in New York City is an opportunity for most companies to test working from home at scale.\n\nApart from contributing to a healthier environment, helping employers and employees save money on transportation and office space, and promoting equal opportunities in the employment market, working from home might be the most efficient containment measure each individual could\u00a0take part of.\n\nOf course, working from home is not ideal, it's a skill, it takes time to acquire, both for employees and employers.

The next hospital they were referred to here in Wuhan, the  city of 11 million people at the center of the outbreak, was full, too, they said. They finally got an intravenous drip for Ms. An\u2019s fever, but that was all.\n\nSince then, Ms. An has quarantined herself at home. She and her son eat separately, wear masks at home and are constantly disinfecting their apartment. Ms. An\u2019s health is declining rapidly, and even keeping water down is a struggle.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t let my mom die at home,\u201d said her son, He Jun. \u201cEvery day I want to cry, but when I cry there are no tears. There is no hope.\u201d\n\nAs countries race to deal with an outbreak that has begun spreading around the world, inciting panic and disrupting the global economy, the residents of Wuhan are waging a daily battle to survive an illness that has sickened more than 4,100 people and killed 224 in their city alone.\n\nLast month, the government put Wuhan in a virtual lockdown, sealing off the city and banning most public transportation and private cars from its streets in a desperate effort to contain the outbreak. Now, many residents say it is nearly impossible to get the health care they need to treat \u2014 or even diagnose \u2014 the coronavirus.\n\nExpressing exasperation, doctors say there is a shortage of testing kits and other medical supplies, and it is not clear why more are not available. The ban on transportation means some residents have to walk for hours to get to hospitals \u2014 if they are well enough to make the journey. Layers of bureaucracy stand between residents and help. And the long lines outside hospitals for testing and treatment suggest that the outbreak is spreading far beyond the official count of cases.\n\nAmbulances, too, are hard to come by, residents say. In recent days, some say they have called 120, China\u2019s equivalent of the emergency number 911, only to be told that there were already hundreds of people in the queue.\n\nThose who do make it to the hospital say they are squeezed together for hours in waiting rooms, where infections are easily spread. But the shortages have meant that many are ultimately turned away and sent home to self-quarantine, potentially compounding the outbreak by exposing their families.\n\nMany doctors and residents are putting their hopes on the two new coronavirus hospitals that China has been racing to build in Wuhan in just a matter of days. One of them spans about eight acres, has 1,000 beds and is scheduled to open on Monday. The government says 1,400 military medical workers will be deployed to work there, potentially helping with the shortage of health professionals on hand to combat the outbreak.\n\nOn Sunday, city officials announced plans to set up quarantine stations around Wuhan for people with symptoms of pneumonia and close contacts among coronavirus patients. But just over a week into the lockdown, many residents believe the virus has already spread much further than the official numbers suggest.\n\n\u201cThe situation that we\u2019ve seen is much worse than what has been officially reported,\u201d Long Jian, 32, said outside a hospital where his elderly father was being treated. Mr. Long said his father had to go to six hospitals and wait seven days before he could even be tested for the coronavirus.\n\nJust steps from where Mr. Long spoke, beds could be seen lining both sides of a narrow corridor in the emergency room. One man was getting an intravenous drip outside in his car.\n\n\u201cThose who can get diagnosed and treated are the lucky ones,\u201d Mr. Long said. \u201cIn our neighborhood, many who weren\u2019t able to get diagnosed ended up dying at home.\u201d\n\nGetting treatment for the coronavirus in a hospital requires jumping through a number of hoops.\n\nAccording to official guidelines, patients are encouraged to go to their local hospitals first for initial assessments and sometimes prescriptions. Then patients are to deliver the results to their local neighborhood committees, which are responsible for communicating with the hospitals and coordinating resources for the households in their areas. There are about 1,000 neighborhood committees in Wuhan, for a population of 11 million.\n\nPatients with mild symptoms are typically told to go home and self-quarantine, according to a Jan. 24 notice by city officials. Those who have more severe symptoms are flagged by the neighborhood committees, which arrange for transportation by ambulance to one of the two dozen or so hospitals designated for treating the coronavirus.\n\nBut in practice, patients and their relatives say that the process takes far too long, and that the bar for what constitutes \u201csevere symptoms\u201d has been set too high \u2014 so they give up and try waiting in long lines at hospitals instead.\n\nAmy Hu said her 64-year-old mother went to the doctor after experiencing a fever, cough, shortness of breath and diarrhea about 10 days ago. Based on the initial assessment, the doctor told Ms. Hu\u2019s mother that she had contracted the coronavirus. But the test needed to confirm the diagnosis was not available, the doctor said.\n\nWithout the test, her mother couldn\u2019t be admitted to a hospital. Since then, Ms. Hu said, they have been waiting at home to hear back from the hospital about when her mother can be tested. In recent days Ms. Hu, who has been visiting her parents for the Lunar New Year holiday, took precautions herself: She checked into a hostel with her two children.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very dissatisfied with the government,\u201d Ms. Hu said. \u201cIt\u2019s like only when the patients are close to death can they be admitted to a hospital.\u201d\n\nTong Yixuan, 31, said Sunday that he panicked last week when he learned that in just a few days, his father\u2019s cold had escalated into a full-blown illness that doctors said was almost certainly the coronavirus.\n\nBut neither his father, who had a 104-degree fever and was slipping in and out of consciousness, nor his mother, who was starting to show similar symptoms, could get tested. Hospitals said that there was no space, and that their symptoms were not severe enough, Mr. Tong said. His parents were sent home to quarantine themselves.\n\nThere was no way for Mr. Tong to help. He was more than 60 miles away in Huangshi, which days ago had been locked down by the government along with many other cities in Hubei Province. The roads out of Huangshi and into Wuhan had all been sealed off. For days, Mr. Tong was stuck. Only Saturday, after hours of negotiation with local officials, was he able to make it to his parents\u2019 bedside, he said. They have since been tested for the coronavirus, and his father has been admitted to a hospital. The process took 10 days.\n\n\u201cAll I want to do is take care of my parents,\u201d Mr. Tong said. \u201cI don\u2019t even care if I get infected.\u201d\n\nFor some people, like Gan Hanjiang, the new hospitals cannot be built fast enough.\n\nLast month, his father came down with a severe fever and cough. He was tested for the coronavirus, but the results were negative. Ten days after the onset of symptoms, however, his father died, Mr. Gan said.\n\nThe hospital classified the cause as \u201csevere pneumonia,\u201d Mr. Gan said, but he believes it was the coronavirus. Several experts have recently conceded that several rounds of testing may be needed for an accurate diagnosis of the virus.\n\nOn the day his father died, Mr. Gan began to show the same symptoms, he said. But without a car, he has not been able to go to one of the designated hospitals to get tested for the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cGetting treatment is so difficult,\u201d he whispered slowly by telephone from a small hospital near his home where he was being treated for viral pneumonia. \u201cWe can\u2019t get admitted to the hospitals. And there\u2019s not enough medicine.\u201d\n\nElsie Chen contributed reporting.\n\nAmy Qin is a China correspondent for The New York Times in Beijing covering the intersection of culture, politics and society.", "subreddit": "China", "created_utc": 1580691085, "author": "vilekangaree", "link_id": "t3_exyjr0", "parent_id": "t3_exyjr0", "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": true, "disgust": true, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": true, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fkpy4y3": {"body": "&gt;The scripting of it was the choreographed nature of the communist Chinese the EU mainstream controlled media.

Some of them think they\u2019ve found the key to fast wins on the stock market. Wall Street doubts they\u2019re right, but it\u2019s getting nervous about what it sees there.\n\n\nHistory hasn\u2019t been kind to people claiming to have a magic hand. The latest sell-off, driven by a new wave of coronavirus fears, shows how quickly markets can turn on you. But even veteran traders have trouble dismissing a 900,000-user Reddit forum called\u00a0r/wallstreetbets, or r/WSB for short, whose tips and tactics have shown an uncanny ability to push prices, at least for the short term. Hitherto sleepy companies such as\u00a0Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc.\u00a0and\u00a0Plug Power Inc.\u00a0went\u00a0crazy\u00a0shortly after being mentioned there. The board may have added a little froth to\u00a0Tesla Inc.\u2019s $90 billion rally.\n\n\nThe do-it-yourself traders of r/WSB are waging a kind of guerrilla warfare in the markets, trying to exploit what they see as weaknesses in the system to move prices where they want them. For anyone who wondered about where the small day traders who made the 1990s so wild went, meet the 2020 version. After years of indifference, individual investors seem to be finding their wayback to stocks, for\u00a0better or worse. They\u2019re flexing muscles in ways that can easily call to mind excesses from the dot-com era.\n\n\n\u201cThere is no denying the fact that in the month of February 2020, the public is back,\u201d says\u00a0Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at\u00a0BTIG LLC. He thinks the S&amp;P 500 can jump an extra 10% because of small-investor enthusiasm. \u201cThis bull market is not going to end until the public falls in love with stocks, and that process may just be beginning.\u201d Of course, timing the moment when irrational exuberance gives way to a mass exit isn\u2019t so easy. Chatrooms where stocks were hyped are seminal artifacts of the 1990s boom and the following bust. They were a setting for bare-fisted digital brawls among all manner of hustlers and promoters, many of whom could move shares on a dime\u2014sometimes just enough so they could get out and leave others holding the bag.\n\n\nTwenty years later, one thing that\u2019s changed is the nomenclature. It\u2019s frequently both juvenile and objectionable. For Reddit\u2019s band of self-styled \u201cautists\u201d\u2014a term of endearment, relatively speaking, that crudely leans into stereotypes surrounding extremely online people\u2014the chief prize is \u201ctendies\u201d (chicken tenders, the treat an overgrown man-child receives for being a \u201cGood Boy\u201d). Figuratively speaking, tendies are the financial rewards that follow from a successful bold wager. Bears are usually referred to in homophobic terms.\n\n\nWhat this moment shares with 1999 is a rising belief that someone else will come along to buy a surging stock at an even higher price, regardless of fundamentals. But while traders at the end of the millennium were willing to wait around for a \u201cgreater fool\u201d to show up, this generation believes it can conjure up those buyers through its own trading sleight of hand.\nFeatured in\u00a0Bloomberg Businessweek, March 2, 2020.\u00a0Subscribe now.\n\n\nMembers of r/WSB believe they\u2019ve discovered a kind of perpetual motion machine in the interplay of stocks withoptions contracts, which offer a cheap way to bet on whether shares will rise or fall without buying the stock itself. It goes like this: Members make bets that rely on market makers, the professional middlemen who sell you a \u201ccall\u201d (a bet on shares rising) or a \u201cput\u201d (a wager on a decline). Market makers, like good bookies, don\u2019t want to go out on a limb. When taking a bet, they lay off the risk. If someone buys a call, for instance, speculating on a rally, the dealer buys stock in the underlying company. If the stock rises, the dealer may have to pay out on the option\u2014but that\u2019s offset by the gain on the shares.\n\n\nWhen shares keep rising, managing the hedge entails buying more stock. That\u2019s where the Reddit set perceives a weakness. A favorite tactic on r/WSB is to swamp the market with call purchases early in the morning in an attempt to force dealers to keep buying stock. Up and up everything goes\u2014supposedly. As the stock price rises, so does the value of the calls, often by far more.\nIn this worldview, the only constraint on success is the force of one\u2019s own conviction and willingness to act upon it. An added attraction: It\u2019s all relatively cheap in terms of an option\u2019s simple dollar cost. For the price of one share of\u00a0Amazon.com Inc.\u2014about $1,965 on Feb. 25\u2014a decent-size campaign can be waged in long-shot options trading for pennies. That matters nowadays, when the rise of exchange-traded funds and mutual funds has convinced U.S. companies that they no longer need to split their stocks to keep the share price manageable for retail investors. Many companies now trade for three or four figures a share.\n\n\nTo be clear, there\u2019s no magic money machine in options. The middlemen of the market are hardly the only players buying and selling stocks. If the rest of the market sees a reason to sell a company, it won\u2019t matter that r/WSB is pushing it. While options can produce eye-popping gains, they frequently expire worthless.\n\n\nBut suddenly bullish individual investors are putting their mark on the options market. How influential have they become? Typically puts are in higher demand than calls because traders are more interested in hedging against losses. That\u2019s often not the case now\u2014with some stocks, demand for the bullish calls is higher. \u201cThis is not normal,\u201d said\u00a0Amy Wu Silverman, an equity derivatives strategist at\u00a0RBC Capital Markets, on Bloomberg TV recently.\n\n\nBenn Eifert, chief investment officer at\u00a0QVR Advisors, was initially skeptical that the money behind these online message boards could sway anything. He changed his mind. \u201cAt least from the dealers\u201d\u2014the middlemen\u2014\u201cthey\u2019ll tell you in big tech names, flows are substantial, and it\u2019s moving things,\u201d he says. Smaller stocks are even more sensitive to sudden bursts of attention.\n\n\nBTIG\u2019s Emanuel says it\u2019s hard to say whether today\u2019s chatrooms or those in the late 1990s have bigger sway. \u201cWhen I was sitting in a proprietary trading room in 1999, you would see certain stocks be mentioned on message boards, and the process would then be one person saying to another, \u2018Hey, this looks interesting,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. \u201cNow you see something on a message board, and you might not necessarily see a continued discussion.\u201d Instead, computerized traders automatically jump in. \u201cAs a human you never actually see the flow because it\u2019s going electronically,\u201d Emanuel says. In other words, don\u2019t just wag a finger at message boards\u2014look at the supposedly sophisticated algorithmic traders that are following them.\n\n\nMembers are aware that questionable thinking underpins their bets, to the point of self-deprecation. After user SolTrainRnsOnHolGran wondered whether r/WSB\u2019s activities might constitute insider trading, a user named recentlyunearthed replied, \u201cHow can we have insider knowledge when we don\u2019t have any knowledge?\u201d\n\n\nThe forum\u2019s zest for call options is a key force behind a broad market trend. By one measure, the value of options traded rose 77% over the first six weeks of 2020. Much of this expansion was concentrated in a handful of stocks popular among individual investors, says\u00a0John Marshall, head of derivatives research at\u00a0Goldman Sachs Group Inc. \u201cThe size of the increase in options volumes is definitely moving the needle,\u201d he says.\n\n\nThe average number of contracts purchased in a single-stock option trade shrunk to just 6.7 contracts in 2020, roughly half what it was in 2015, says\u00a0Henry Schwartz, president of Trade Alert LLC. Looking at the combination of small orders and heavy trading volume, he concludes, \u201cReally, retail is the only audience.\u201d\n\n\nAs the swashbuckling day trader\u2019s imprint on the market becomes more pronounced, moderators are getting stricter in their policing of the board\u2014or \u201csub,\u201d for subreddit. One user, who\u2019d been a member for three years without posting, laid out the bull case for\u00a0Lumber Liquidators Inc.\u00a0and promised another pick the following morning. Call volumes in the company jumped to 71 times the previous one-month average, with shares rising 18.6%.

Denmark has 864 confirmed cases. Assuming that's all of them, then there's likely between 71,000 and 108,000 actual cases in the country. Again, it's a faulty assumption that this is a perfect lookup-table, but it is something to keep in mind, because we might think \"*well, the likelihood of me meeting one of those 864 or someone who has is low*\", but once you up that to between 1 and 2% of the entire population, that's a lot more likely. New York currently has 729 confirmed cases according to the Johns Hopkins tracker, which (if this table is 100% accurate, which it won't be) is around day 28 of the infection, which suggests somewhere between 40,000 and 70,000 infected people. I shudder to think of the consequences of it getting into a massively packed metropolis like New York City, and with that many infected it's more or less guaranteed to.\n\nThank you for correcting me - I don't like misinformation, and I like it even less when I'm the one inadvertently spreading it.", "subreddit": "worldnews", "created_utc": 1584315038, "author": "MartinSchou", "link_id": "t3_fj1umv", "parent_id": "t1_fklnyxv", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": true, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": true, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fk5cxor": {"body": "July is awful.\n\nBut I think it depends where you go.

If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.\n\n### Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth\n\n**Why?**\u00a0Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.\n\n### Practice respiratory hygiene\n\nMake sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.\n\n**Why?**\u00a0Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.\n\n### If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early\n\nStay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.\n\n**Why?**\u00a0National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.\n\n### Stay informed and follow advice given by your healthcare provider\n\nStay informed on the latest developments about COVID-19. Follow advice given by your healthcare provider, your national and local public health authority or your employer on how to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.\n\n**Why?**\u00a0National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on whether COVID-19 is spreading in your area. They are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves.\n\n# Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading\n\n\u00b7 Follow the guidance outlined above.\n\n\u00b7 Stay at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache and slight runny nose, until you recover.\u00a0**Why?**\u00a0Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.\n\n\u00b7 If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers.\u00a0**Why?**\u00a0Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.\n\nIf\u00a0you have any questions, you can contact me and I hope to help you.\n\nMy email : iamgo-001@outlook.com\n\nIn the end, I know that you need masks, paper towels, protective glasses and other supplies recently.

Deaths due to the CCP virus may have contributed to the high number of account closings.  \n  \nCellphones are an indispensable part of life in China.  \n  \n\u201cThe digitization level is very high in China. People can\u2019t survive without a cellphone,\u201d Tang Jingyuan, a U.S.-based China affairs commentator, told The Epoch Times on March 21. \u201cDealing with the government for pensions and social security, buying train tickets, shopping \u2026 no matter what people want to do, they are required to use cellphones.  \n  \n\u201cThe Chinese regime requires all Chinese to use their cellphones to generate a health code. Only with a green health code are Chinese allowed to move in China now. It\u2019s impossible for a person to cancel his cellphone.\u201d  \n  \nChina introduced mandatory facial scans on Dec. 1, 2019, to confirm the identity of the person who registered the phone. As early as Sept. 1, 2010, China required all cellphone users to register phones with their real identification, by which the state can control people\u2019s speech via its large-scale monitoring system.  \n  \nFurthermore, Chinese people\u2019s bank accounts and social security accounts are bundled with their cellphone plans; apps on Chinese phones check SIM cards against the state\u2019s database to make sure the number belongs to the user.  \n  \nBeijing first launched cellphone-based health codes on March 10. All people in China must install a cellphone app and register their personal health information. Then the app can generate a QR code, which appears in three colors, to classify the user\u2019s health level. Red means the person has an infectious disease, yellow means the person might have one, and green means the person doesn\u2019t.  \n  \nBeijing claimed that the health codes are intended to prevent the spread of the CCP virus, commonly known as novel coronavirus.  \n  \nChina\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) announced on March 19 the number of phone users in each province in February. Compared with the previous announcement, which was released on Dec. 18, 2019, for November 2019 data, both cellphone and landline users dropped dramatically. In the same period the year before, the number of users increased.  \n  \nThe number of cellphone users decreased from 1.600957 billion to 1.579927 billion, a drop of 21.03 million. The number of landline users decreased from 190.83 million to 189.99 million, a drop of 840,000.  \n  \nIn the previous February, the number increased. According to MIIT, the number of cellphone users increased in February 2019 from 1.5591 billion to 1.5835 billion, which is 24.37 million more. The number of landline users increased from 183.477 million to 190.118 million, which is 6.641 million more.  \n  \nAccording to China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics, the country\u2019s population at the end of 2019 was 4.67 million larger than in 2018, reaching 1.40005 billion.  \n  \nThe 2020 decrease in landline users may be due to the nationwide quarantine in February, during which small businesses were shut down. But the decrease in cellphone users can\u2019t be explained in this way.  \n  \nAccording to the operation data of all three Chinese cellphone carriers, cellphone accounts increased in December 2019 but dropped steeply in 2020.  \n  \nChina Mobile is the largest carrier, holding about 60 percent of the Chinese cellphone market. It reported that it gained 3.732 million more accounts in December 2019, but lost 0.862 million in January 2020 and 7.254 million in February 2020.  \n  \nChina Mobile\u2019s performance in the same months in 2019 was markedly different; it gained 2.411 million more accounts in January 2019 and 1.091 million more in February 2019.\n\nChina Telecom is the second-largest carrier, holding about 21 percent of the market. It gained 1.18 million users in December 2019, but lost 0.43 million users in January 2020 and 5.6 million users in February 2020.\n\nIn 2019, it gained 4.26 million in January and 2.96 million in February.\n\nChina Unicom, which hasn\u2019t yet published the data for February, shares the same experience as the other two telecoms in January 2020 and in early 2019. The company lost 1.186 million users in January 2020, but gained 1.962 million users in February 2019 and 2.763 million users in January 2019.\n\nChina allows each adult to apply for at most five cellphone numbers. Since Feb. 10, the majority of Chinese students have taken online classes with a cellphone number due to their schools being ordered to stay closed. These students\u2019 accounts are under their parents\u2019 names, which means some parents needed to open a new cellphone account in February.  \n  \nAnalyzing the Numbers  \n  \nThe big question is whether the dramatic drop in cellphone accounts reflects the account closings of those who have died due to the CCP virus.  \n  \n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that some migrant workers had two cellphone numbers before. One is from their hometown, and the other is from the city they work in. In February, they might close the number in the city they work in because they couldn\u2019t go there,\u201d Tang said. Typically, migrant workers would have gone to their home city for the Chinese New Year in January, and then travel restrictions would have prevented them from returning to the city where they held a job.  \n  \nHowever, because there is a basic monthly fee to hold a cellphone account in China, the majority of migrant workers\u2014the lowest income group\u2014are likely to only have one cellphone account.  \n  \nChina had 288.36 million migrant workers as of April 2019, according to the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics.  \n  \nOn March 17, Meng Wei, spokesman of China\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission, said at a monthly press conference in Beijing that except for Hubei, all provinces reported that more than 90 percent of their businesses resumed operations. In Zhejiang, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Shandong, Guangxi, and Chongqing, almost all businesses resumed production.  \n  \nIf both the number of migrant workers and the level of employment are accurate, more than 90 percent of migrant workers have gone back to work.  \n  \nThe economic dislocation caused by shutdowns in China may have also led some people who have an extra cellphone to cancel it. With business poor or stopped, they may not want to carry the extra expense.  \n  \n\u201cAt present, we don\u2019t know the details of the data. If only 10 percent of the cellphone accounts were closed because the users died because of the CCP virus, the death toll would be 2 million,\u201d Tang said.  \n  \nThe reported death toll in China doesn\u2019t line up with what can otherwise be determined about the situation there.  \n  \nA comparison with the situation in Italy also suggests the Chinese death toll is significantly underreported. Italy adopted similar measures to those used by the Chinese regime. The CCP virus death toll in Italy of 4,825 translates to a death rate of 9 percent. In China, where a much larger population was exposed to the virus, the reported death toll of 3,265 translated to a death rate of only 4 percent, less than half that reported in Italy.  \n  \nActivities in the outbreak epicenter of Hubei Province seem to contradict the reported death toll in China. The seven funeral homes in the city of Wuhan were reported to be burning bodies 24 hours a day, seven days a week in late January. Hubei Province has used 40 mobile cremators, each capable of burning five tons of medical waste and bodies a day, since Feb. 16.  \n  \nLacking data, the real death toll in China is a mystery. The cancellation of 21 million cellphones provides a data point that suggests the real number may be far higher than the official number.  \n  \nThe Epoch Times refers to the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19, as the CCP virus because the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s coverup and mismanagement allowed the virus to spread throughout China and create a global pandemic.", "subreddit": "conspiracy", "created_utc": 1584987085, "author": "MeridianOne", "link_id": "t3_fnkxqp", "parent_id": "t1_flagdwt", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fkvz0rt": {"body": "Full article by [Laurie Garrett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Garrett):\n\nA few days ago I shared wine, cheese, and camaraderie with a small group of close friends, and sadly, after five excellent bottles of C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne wine, we said goodbye to one another, knowing we shall not again share company for many weeks, perhaps months. Yesterday my dearest neighbors knocked on the door, carts loaded with suitcases and boxes in tow, to wish me well for the duration of the great pandemic. We air-hugged, and I sadly watched them tromp off to their packed vehicle, abandoning New York City for their country home. As they wandered off, I said, \u201cSee you in September, I hope\u2014or whenever things are normal again.\u201d\n\nFor some countries\u2014Italy, South Korea, and Singapore for example\u2014the moment of decision and personal preparation has long since passed, and millions of people are stuck in place, watching their epidemic unfold. On the eve of St. Patrick\u2019s Day, the mayor of San Francisco ordered her entire population to \u201cshelter in place\u201d for a few weeks: The window of opportunity to relocate has closed for residents of the Bay Area.\n\nWhether you are reading this in your living room in Vancouver, office in London, or on a subway in New York City, you need to think hard, and fast, about two crucial questions: Where, and with whom, do you want to spend the next six to 12 weeks of your life, hunkered down for the epidemic duration? And what can you do to make that place as safe as possible for yourself and those around you?\n\nYour time to answer those questions is very short\u2014a few days, at most. Airports will close, trains will shut down, gasoline supplies may dwindle, and roadblocks may be set up. Nations are closing their borders, and as the numbers of sick rise, towns, suburbs, even entire counties will try to shut the virus out by blocking travel. Wherever you decide to settle down this week is likely to be the place in which you will be stuck for the duration of your epidemic.\n\nTo appreciate what lies ahead for the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom, pay heed to Italy, France, and Germany. The United States, for example, is currently tracking exactly where Italy was about 10 days ago. France and Germany, which track two to five days ahead of the United States, are now revving up measures akin to those taken by Italy, including lockdowns on movement and social activity. In a matter of days, the United States will follow suit.\n\nIf you live alone, have no family members or close friends who require your special attention, and have no alternative living space, you have no decision to make. You are where you will be for coming weeks.\n\nMany households are now swelling as colleges and universities close, sending students to their parents\u2019 homes, and young adults find themselves facing financial ruin amid the shutdown of theaters, restaurants, gig economy work, construction sites, and other forms of employment lacking job protection and home leave assistance. These young adults may also choose to return to their parents\u2019 homes, or to secondary residences owned by friends or relatives.\n\nAs employers shift to work-from-home status, white-collar workers with salaried jobs need to consider where best to hunker down, allowing them strong Internet access and a home work setting. For workers whose jobs require physical presence at a work site, such as custodians, factory workers, security guards, construction personnel, taxi drivers, and the like, the relocation option is decided\u2014stay put. But many may lose their jobs, either temporarily or permanently, due to the epidemic, and the prospect of six to eight weeks without an income stream is excruciating. Anybody facing that prospect should immediately negotiate with their landlords, mortgage lenders, and utilities, seeking long-term payment options, and scour for information regarding their legal rights if threatened with eviction, power shut-off, or lost credit due to epidemic-spawned nonpayment.\n\nBecause elderly people, particularly those with underlying medical conditions, are at special risk for severe reactions to COVID-19, including death, many families are making choices to move closer to their aged loved ones, or bring them to live with their adult children and grandchildren. These can be painful decisions, particularly if the elder\u2019s health requires daily attention or features dementia. As the epidemic worsens, it will become increasingly dangerous for such elders to travel: Tough choices must be made immediately.\n\nOnce tough location decisions have been made, the household must be readied for a long siege. While panic-buying has led to stockpiles of toilet paper and hand sanitizer, getting through eight months of confinement with others will require a great deal more, both physically and psychologically. This is especially true for households that span generations.\n\nLong-term confinement that includes children undergoing remote schooling and adults trying to work requires designated spaces for each individual, a powerful Internet signal and Wi-Fi router, and a great deal of shared patience. Everybody in the household must understand how the coronavirus is spread, and what steps each should follow to eliminate their personal risk of passing infection to others in the home.\n\nThe virus is transmitted by droplets and fomites\u2014it isn\u2019t like measles, capable of drifting about in the air for hours. It dehydrates quickly if not inside water, mucus, or fomite droplets. The size of the droplets may be far below what the human eye can see, but they are gravity-sensitive, and will fall from an individual\u2019s mouth down, eventually, to the nearest lower surface\u2014table, desk, floor. You do not need to clean upward.\n\nHowever, a newly published study, backed by the National Institutes of Health, found that the virus survives in \u201caerosols for up to three hours, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel.\u201d This means an uncleaned surface can pose a risk to members of the household for a very long time\u2014a doorknob, tabletop, kitchen counter or stainless steel utensil.\n\nBoth the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Occupational Safety and Health Administration have posted cleaning guidelines, indicating which simple, inexpensive products can eliminate the coronavirus from surfaces in your household or work areas. Give special attention to the most commonly shared surfaces in your home or work area: door knobs, light switches, phones, faucets, toilet handles, kitchen utensils, computer keyboards, and remote controls.\n\nThe virus is killed by ultraviolet sunlight, and air flow will hasten dehydration. Do not create air flow by turning on building central air systems\u2014you will spread contamination. If there are windows, open them wide and leave them open whenever weather conditions allow. If there are curtains or shades, open them and let sunlight pour in.\n\nIf available, wear latex or heavy-duty dishwashing gloves while cleaning anything that an individual suspected to be infected with COVID-19 has had contact with. Place all used gloves and other disposable contaminated items in a bag that can be tied closed before disposing of them with other waste. Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds immediately after removing gloves.\n\nIf you live in an apartment, condominium, or co-housing facility, ask management to post signs limiting the number of people allowed to share an elevator to however many can fit in the cars while maintaining a distance of three feet from one another. Elevator buttons should be cleaned regularly. Deliveries should be left in a common area, such as the building lobby, rather than having outsiders use the elevators and knock on household doors.\n\nAnd all residents should be asked to please be mindful of contagion courtesy, covering mouths when coughing or sneezing and teaching children to do the same. After coughing or sneezing into hands, do not touch public surfaces in the building such as elevator buttons, banisters, and door handles.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to prepare psychologically. Every family or couple has its issues, and tensions can amplify during long confinement. Common sense can ease the shared suffering.\n\nIf children are undergoing remote schooling, and parents are simultaneously working remotely, everybody needs headphones, plenty of computer bandwidth, and a designated workspace. Before stores close, make sure every user has proper cables, headphones, batteries, adapters, and other tools of the computer trade.\n\nPrinters, if they will be used, require paper and ink: Have plenty on hand.\n\nEverybody needs routines, including exercise and recreation. Shared burdens of cooking and cleaning should be offset by shared play and fun.\n\nBoredom and stress can suck the lifeblood out of a person. Before your home goes on lockdown, make sure your download accounts for movies and television are paid. There are plenty of good books around the house, and games and decks of cards are handy.\n\nPlan now for your state of siege. Don\u2019t delay. Choose where you want to survive the pandemic, with whom, and how. Your window of opportunity to act is shrinking, very fast.", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1584579766, "author": "ssldvr", "link_id": "t3_fl0y9q", "parent_id": "t3_fl0y9q", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": true, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": true, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": true, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fk53a31": {"body": "Every country in Europe started from the same position on 31st Dec 2019 when China made the genome of the virus available to the world.\n\nOutcomes depend on certain decisions, like early testing, whether to ban flights and so on.

I see the EU as having many, many problems democratically.

The [global cash index (pdf)](https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/The-Global-Cash-Index-Middle-East-And-South-Africa-Analysis-January-2018.pdf) - the source of the picture linked - tells us that the relative ratio of cash payments is more than twice as high in Italy than in the US. In Germany and Austria, it's even higher. In Vienna, you can't even pay with card in many restaurants, bars or caf\u00e9s. Austrians also greet themselves affectionately, often with kisses left and right. Furthermore, public transportation is (unlike in the US) working very well and everybody uses it. I therefore suspect that the infection rates in Vienna, but also Germany and Switzerland (also cash crazy, and they even do three kisses when greeting) will rise at a much higher rate than for example in Northern Europe. There, the situation is different. Contactless payment is strong and people greet themselves less affectionate, in some situations don't even shake hands (depending on the country). Therefore I suspect the virus will not spread as quickly there, although temperatures might be colder for a longer time.\n\nIn the meantime, **try to avoid paying with cash**. We *know* bank notes are contaminated. We *know* the virus can stay on surfaces for days. We *know* the Chinese are quarantining bank notes. This is not a conspiracy theory and I'm wondering why nobody here in Europe is mentioning this.", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1583064734, "author": "7a11l409b1d3c65", "link_id": "t3_fbt834", "parent_id": "t3_fbt834", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": true, "sadness": false, "surprise": true, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fkpkzbl": {"body": "In the same post, you admit that London isn't the biggest market  but then that the US size doesn't matter (utter bs) and finish by some more BS about London's importance for the world.

Where? At an open air fish and meat market. Anyone looking into contaminated flesh at the market? Dangerous lack of sanitation? They\u2019re looking into \u201cthe virus.\u201d Naturally. \n\n&gt;And as I keep saying in past and recent articles, we have a massive tradition of FAKE EPIDEMICS.\n\n&gt;You have to understand: most people don\u2019t want to hear this. It\u2019s rather astonishing. Most people feel compelled to believe in the virus, believe it\u2019s dangerous, it\u2019s a killer, it\u2019s real, it\u2019s a global threat. Pro-vaccine people, anti-vaccine people, it doesn\u2019t matter. They salute THE VIRUS.\n\n&gt;[In my last article](https://blog.nomorefakenews.com/2020/01/22/is-the-new-deadly-china-virus-a-covert-operation/), I detailed how former \u201cepidemics,\u201d SARS (coronavirus) and Swine Flu, turned out to be complete fakes. Eventually, it leaked out that medical experts couldn\u2019t find the virus in people. You should really read that article, and read it again. And think about the implications.\n\n&gt;Medical research honchos and the press are still calling the 2003 SARS dud an epidemic. Official stats indicate 800 people died, worldwide. If that\u2019s an epidemic, there are pink tigers walking around on the far side of the moon.\n\n&gt;Now, when they talk about rushing a vaccine into production \u201cagainst the virus,\u201d that\u2019s a whole different story. They tried that in 2009 with Swine Flu, and it caused profound and horrific results. I\u2019ve read the patent info that\u2019s now circulating on the Web\u2014for a vaccine against a coronavirus. It\u2019s hard to tell, but it could be a DNA vaccine. If it is, that means the vaccine will permanently alter the genetic makeup of anyone who takes the shot.\n\n&gt;Here\u2019s something else you should think about. The so-called origin points of epidemics. SARS (2003), the Amoy Gardens apartment complex in Hong Kong. Swine Flu (2009), a giant commercial pig farm in La Gloria, Mexico. And now, in 2020, the Chinese coronavirus, an open air animal and fish market in Wuhan.\n\n&gt;At the Amy Gardens complex, there were leaks in the pipes. Human waste was leaking. People were falling ill. My, what a surprise. They needed to call in a plumber, not the World Health Organization virus hunters.\n\n&gt;At the pig farm, in La Gloria, huge feces lagoons, yes, were lying there out in the sun. The lagoons were routinely sprayed with toxic chemicals. Workers were falling ill. What a shock. So they brought in people to spray even more toxic chemicals on the pig shit lagoons. They needed a major environmental clean-up. Instead, they got World Health and CDC virus hunters.\n\n&gt;And now, in Wuhan, the virus hunters are at it again. They want to test the animal flesh at the market for viruses. Here are a few recommendations. Check the water supply in the market. Is it dirty? Check the refrigeration. Are the fish and animal meat always fresh? Is the place clean? Is it washed down well every day? Actually LOOK at the premises. I know, it\u2019s a revolutionary act, but steel yourself and go ahead.\n\n&gt;\u201cYes, but what about the other cases of the China coronavirus that have been identified in other countries? Where did they come from?\u201d\n\n&gt;Answer: How do you know these other cases are a result of the coronavirus? The symptoms in most of these fake epidemics are the same\u2014they\u2019re basic flu symptoms\u2014fatigue, fever, cough, weakness. A person could come down with THAT for a hundred different reasons.\n\n&gt;I started writing about viruses that were never proved to cause human illness\u2014or weren\u2019t even there to begin with\u2014in 1987. All these years later, I find myself still doing it. Why?\n\n&gt;**BECAUSE \u2018THE VIRUS\u201d IS THE GREATEST COVER STORY ON THE PLANET. IT ATTRACTS BELIEVERS FROM WALL TO WALL.**\n\n&gt;Professionals invoke it to cover up a multitude of crimes.\n\n&gt;For example, in parts of Africa, where the water supplies are contaminated to the hilt, where people are hungry and dying of starvation, where people have chronic diarrhea and are dying from dehydration, where extreme poverty and war for economic gain are routine, where corporate interests are stealing farm land from the people and poisoning the environment, where toxic medical drugs and vaccines are killing people whose immune systems are already compromised\u2014you can ignore all that because\u2026the real problem, the one serious problem, you see, is:\n\n&gt;**THE VIRUS.**\n\n&gt;Sure. Pump up that story to the max, get medical testimony, research money, the whole insane apparatus, and paint over what is actually happening there, and you\u2019re in. You\u2019re in control.

But if you were thinking and properly informed you'd know that this is the least of the reasons that wearing a mask makes no difference.\n\nYou are now posing as a professional. Now, while I find this perfectly believable as most people who have received the training you have doesn't change that they're largely morons, the attitude you are taking now points to more likely you're just posing and think it is going to mean anything as you're talking as if you've found some common talking point.\n\nThe thing with masks is that they simply will not protect you from coronavirus. Truly what will protect you from the coronavirus is absolute self-isolation in a home with all the doors locked and this is the only way you will survive without having the virus, my sweet innocent little medical professional of certain intelligence. I'm afraid that you being a professional doesn't mean anything.\n\nThe masks which possibly reduce droplets you are expelling and so may protect certain people at a certain distance from you and protect yourself from bits of spit in your face is in practice just as good as people trained to use the the golden standard of air filtration nose-fitted mask which the n95 claims it sticks all around your mouth so technically the viruses and bacteria don't pass through this mask but only molecules of air so no biological material that's alive will pass through the filter. But in practice you find yourself with huge problems of that when you get infected such as a cloud of contaminated particles generated from whatever event happen to bei n the pocket of air you are going to inhale from and often if you inhale 100% you will be infected, and if you inhale 1% you will be infected, let alone wearing these masks all day and the effect your breath over that time will have on their supposed perfect standard filtration unit construction over time, and that if you're going in public with these n95 masks your hands have the coronavirus all over them, your shirt has the coronavirus, and you're going to have to remove this mask at some point, you're fingers have it, you touch yourself, you don't clean yourself or if you do clean yourself you don't clean yourself enough.\nThe n95 mask is only working in an ideal scenario. You're not in an ideal scenario if you're not a doctor with staff around you who remove your mask such as I'm holding my hands in the air while my assistant is attaching my sterile gloves and attaching my robe in my back. If you're not in that situation the n95 doesn't mean much. And so you're going to end up at home and even if you were to filter out the virus (which if it does you'd be okay anyway, and if it doesn't you'd simply be similarly infected anyway) you're going to give it to your family. So masks are just not a good strategy here.\n\nI've seen the strategy used by some people in Wuhan of being in a complete transparent garbage bag and having a small place in the bottom to breathe from. I would say this may be more efficient than the n95 in certain scenarios, but not really. Better yet you can look cool like you don't care, and better you can wear sun glasses which really are more effective than any mask or garbage suit and look very cool wearing sun glasses.\n\nMeanwhile trained medical personel wearing legitimate n95 professionally kept being handled by assistant with sterilised hands and you have your arms out and they put the mask on for your and then remove it for you - these people are getting infected. So you know I'm afraid to inform you that you're going to have to get fucking real my friend, but thanks for reminding me of the quality of intelligence we have working throughout.\n\nThe doctors who died from coronavirus they had the n95 and they had a brand new legitimate one with filtration unit built maybe even to standards claimed (which is bs and even if true in practice is not going to prevent all the smaller particles coming through) and not breathed on for hours and everything, and they knew how to wash their hands, and they had the glasses, but it's not enouguh, and where are many of them now my sweet little darling? They're dead.\n\nBecause this virus is coming for your little butt hole and there is not shit you can do about it unless you quarantine yourself in your bank vault and do not allow anyone in. And if you were properly informed and had the intelligence to process that information you'd know that there's no point in telling people to wear masks, it's a complete joke. But all you know is how important they've told you it is to wipe down phones and to look at numbers and say one is bigger than the other without understanding context.\n\nYou just look like a mug in your mask. There isn't some cabal of lizards lying to you, the experts are simply telling you the truth of that masks don't really make any difference to average joe and there's not any point in wearing one to try and protect yourself from the virus.", "subreddit": "China_Flu", "created_utc": 1583334187, "author": "Master_Tibbs", "link_id": "t3_fcxx78", "parent_id": "t1_fjgpe79", "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": true, "disgust": true, "fear": true, "joy": true, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fk3ngea": {"body": "**GC seats**\n\nproportional system we normally get 55-60% of the vote, with this I would assume we will get 60-65% of the vote (so 60-65% of 35 so 21-23 geographic constituencies).\n\nThis is because in previous DC elections Pro-dems get 40% of the public vote, but in the recent election we got 57%, that along with gov loosing even more popularity since then cus of their lack of competence with dealing with the outbreak of covid 19 is why I think for GC's pro-dems will get 60-65% of the vote.\n\n**DC 2nd**\n\nNormally we win 3/5 of DC2'nd seats, (which everyone in HK vote for), I think we can either maintain the 3/5 or even get 4/5 (so that's a total of 24-27 seats).\n\n**DC 1st**\n\n+1 for DC1st because we got a majority in all the DC's (apart from Islands (which raises the total seat count to 25-28).\n\n**Other safe FCs:**\n\n+1 Legal (always Pro-dem - making seat count total to 26-29)\n\n+1 Education (always Pro-dem - making seat count total 27-30)\n\n+1 Accountancy (big majority pro-dem - making seat count total 28-31)\n\n+1 Health Services (big majority pro-dem - making seat count total 29-32)\n\n+1 Social Welfare (always has been pro-dem - making seat count total 30-33)\n\n+1 Information Technology (big pro-dem majority - making seat count total 31-34)\n\n+1 Medial (Pro-dem seat currently, most likely going to remain pro-dem seat because of Govt's incompetence with dealing with the covid 19 outbreak (making the seat count total 32-35 ((**possible majority reached**))\n\n**Battleground FCs:**\n\nArchitectural, Surveying, Planning and Landscape - Won in 2016, its rep was dq'd cus of oath taking controversy so there was a re-election and the pro-beijing won by 10%, I would put the chances of Pro-dem camp winning this at 60-70% (making the seat count total 33-36 )\n\nWholesale and Retail - Pro-dem candidate gets around 35% of the vote, however as this constituency has a majority of individuals, instead of corporate voters (like the majority of other FC's), I would put the chances of the pro-dem camp winning this seat at 45%-60% (making the seat count total 34-37)\n\nCatering - Though the pro-dem candidates used to only get around 20-25% of the vote, thanks to the yellow economic circle hundreds of new restaurants are joining this FC *and* old restaurants who used to vote Pro-beijing just because of the economy, changing to pro-democracy as they dont want the Pro-beijing camp retaining their majority - there's also a lot of public activism trying to persuade restaurants to vote yellow in the election.

But it contains worrisome information about one subset \u2014 infants \u2014 and suggests that children may be a critical factor in the disease\u2019s rapid spread.\nAD\n\nThe first thing to know is that children are getting infected across all age groups and genders. Among the patients studied, half were from Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak, while the others were from bordering areas. They ranged in age from newborns to 18 with the median age being 7 years.\nSo what does coronavirus look like in children?\nSurge in coronavirus patients threatens to swamp U.S. hospitals\n\nAccording to the analysis by Shanghai Children\u2019s Medical Center researchers Yuanyuan Dong, Xi Mo and co-authors, mild cases (52 percent) were marked by the typical symptoms of a cold \u2014 fever, fatigue, cough, sore throat, runny nose and sneezing. Some patients had no fever and only digestive symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea.\nAD\n\nThose with moderate infection (39 percent) had pneumonia with frequent fever and cough, mostly dry cough, followed by a wetter cough. Some had wheezing but no obvious shortness of breath.\nSevere cases were rare (5 percent) as were those who required critical care (0.4 percent.) The severe cases began with early respiratory symptoms which were sometimes accompanied by gastrointestinal issues. Around one week the children have more difficulty breathing. Those cases sometimes quickly progressed to critical illness with acute respiratory distress or failure which in turn sometimes led to other organ dysfunction \u2014 heart failure or kidney injury.\nOne boy, a 14-year-old, died on Feb. 7. No further details on the patient were revealed in the study.\nAD\n\nOf special interest to pediatricians is a group of seven infants (11 percent of the total number of infants in the study), and two children in the age 1 to 5 range (15 percent), who progressed to critical condition. The study suggests, the authors wrote, that \u201cyoung children, particularly infants, were vulnerable.\u201d\nThe luckiest group \u2014 4 percent \u2014 did not have any symptoms at all even as nasal or throat swabs showed they were positive for coronavirus infection.\n\u201cWhy most of the children\u2019s COVID-19 cases were less severe than adults\u2019 case is puzzling,\u201d Dong and Mo wrote. \u201cThis may be related to both exposure and host factors.\"\nThe researchers wrote that children may have been more isolated at home after the outbreak began, and therefore had fewer opportunities to be exposed to the pathogens. They also suggested that there was something in the children\u2019s biology \u2014 a cell receptor that binds to the virus \u2014 that might be less sensitive. Another theory is that children often experience colds and other respiratory infections in winter so they may have come into the season with higher levels of antibodies, which are protective, than adults.\nAD\n\nThe Pediatrics editors wrote they were releasing the paper early, within days of it having been peer reviewed but before official publication, due to the topic\u2019s importance. In a commentary accompanying the study, associate editors Andrea Cruz and Steve Zeichner, both physicians, say the study suggests \u201cchildren may play a major role in community-based viral transmission.\u201d\nThe data suggests they may have more symptoms that make them contagious, like runny nose, and that they may have more gastrointestinal symptoms which raises concerns for the virus being in the feces for several weeks after infection.\nHow to manage screen time for kids as coronavirus closes schools\n\nAs schools move to online teaching, students will be spending extra time in front of a screen.

"Regarding symptoms, two items below:\n\n1. A frontline doctor\u2019s general description of symptoms for the Covid\u2019s first three weeks of illness, and\n\n2. A day by day description of symptoms (from day 1 through day 12) and treatment for the first patient in the USA. He began feeling ill on Jan. 15, was admitted to the hospital on Jan. 20th, and was released from the hospital Feb. 3rd/4.\n\nSymptoms explained by Doctor ihttps://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/reporters-notebook-life-and-death-in-a-wuhan-coronavirus-icu: and The JAMA https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2761044\n\n\u201cI've observed that the breakout period of the novel coronavirus tends to be three weeks, from the onset of symptoms to developing difficulties breathing. Basically going from mild to severe symptoms takes about a week. There are all sorts of mild symptoms: feebleness, shortness of breath, some people have fevers, some don't. Based on studies of our 138 cases, the most common symptoms in the first stage are fever (98.6 per cent of cases), feebleness (69.6 per cent), cough (59.4 per cent), muscle pains (34.8 per cent), difficulties breathing (31.2%), while less common symptoms include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.\n\nBut some patients who enter the second week will suddenly get worse. At this stage, people should go to the hospital. The elderly with underlying conditions may develop complications; some may need machine-assisted respiration. When the body's other organs start to fail, that's when it becomes severe, while those with strong immune systems see their symptoms decrease in severity at this stage and gradually recover. So the second week is what determines whether the illness becomes critical.\n\nThe third week determines whether critical illness leads to death. Some in critical condition who receive treatment can raise their level of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and see an improvement in their immune systems, and have been brought back, so to speak. But those whose lymphocyte numbers continue to decline, those whose immune systems are destroyed in the end, experience multiple organ failure and die.\n\nFor most, the illness is over in two weeks, whereas for those for whom the illness becomes severe, if they can survive three weeks, they're good. Those that can't will die in three weeks.\u201d\n\n\n2. And, this:\n\nSymptom Progression Day 1 to Day 12 From\nFirst Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States \n\n35 year old male\n\nhttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191\n\nOn January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided to see a health care provider....\n\nGiven the patient\u2019s travel history, the local and state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the basis of current CDC \u201cpersons under investigation\u201d case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. After specimen collection, the patient was discharged to home isolation with active monitoring by the local health department.\nOn January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that the patient\u2019s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.\n\nOn admission, the patient reported persistent dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient was found to have dry mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.\n\n\nOn days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days 6 through 9 of illness), the patient\u2019s vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Figure 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the serum remained negative.\n\nTreatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.\n\n\nA chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 (illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Figure 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung (Figure 4). These radiographic findings coincided with a change in respiratory status starting on the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient\u2019s oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the changing clinical presentation and concern about hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) and cefepime (administered intravenously every 8 hours) was initiated.\n\n\nOn hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia (Figure 5), and rales were noted in both lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient\u2019s ongoing fevers, the persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple sites, and published reports of the development of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with the development of radiographic pneumonia in this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse events were observed in association with the infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nOn hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient\u2019s clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94 to 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His appetite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. \n\nAs of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospitalized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have resolved with the exception of his cough, which is decreasing in severity.\n\n\n(The above referenced patient survived and was released from hospital and \u201cremains isolated at home.\u201d) see;\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2020-02-04/first-us-coronavirus-patient-released-from-hospital%3fcontext=amp\n\n\n(Please also see these relevant links contributed by r/u/Two_Luffas: \n\nThe JAMA related to the first story: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2761044\n\nHere's the Lancet case study from Jan. 24 : https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext\n\nThe NEJM case study, but includes all of the relevant supporting documents: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191\n\nAnother Lancet case study: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2820%2930211-7/fulltext\n\nLancet case study from Nepal: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30067-0/fulltext)", "subreddit": "China_Flu", "created_utc": 1583627032, "author": "arewebeingplutoed", "link_id": "t3_ff3z8k", "parent_id": "t3_ff3z8k", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fg6h1u8": {"body": "Google translation to English:\n&gt;\nRussia refuses the return flight - the Kramp-Karrenbauer reacts\nAs of: 3:26 p.m.\nGovernments worldwide are alarmed by the rapid spread of the corona virus.

We are in the midst of some freaky stuff that few of us have seen before.  But, this isn't Pearl Harbor, and, unlike the Philippines, the US has the resources to deal with COVID and continue existing.  If we can get over the panic, and the federal government can get it act together, we will be fine.  There have been some good signs the past two days.\n\nA big reason we have panic in the US is mistrust in the federal government.  It doesn't help that the guy at the top of the executive branch has been lying non-stop about things big and small for the past 3 years.  But, isn't just the guy at the top - it's been a team sport, including subordinates,  a large TV network, a series of smaller radio networks, and \"teammates\" in other branches who echo the lies to maintain their status and position (i.e. not lose the upcoming election).\n\nSo, as usual, the federal government's first response to COVID was to do what it has been to date.  Lying.  This included muzzling public health officials, downplaying the severity both in message and action (get people off the boat in Japan but don't test them or give government employees helping the evacuation any protective gear, training, or process as defined by the CDC), selectively blaming countries and states that aren't popular with its voting base (China, Mexico, Washington State), denying care and testing in an effort to keep the \"numbers\" down (No test kits, keep a cruise ship full of Americans from docking in a US port), and putting science deniers in charge of containment in an attempt to control the \"messaging\" (Priority One: Don't expose the lies).\n\nMany of us Americans have overlooked the lies in the past, because there really haven't been crises that affect most of our day to day lives for the past three years.  But now shits real.  We are acknowledging the charade through a stock market crash and panic buying of toilet paper.\n\nSome parts of the government have started acting sanely.  It started with state governments who clearly saw the US federal government had no clue.  This included governments from both \"teams\", \"Red States\" and \"Blue States\", doing what they could to enact sane and rational containment plans.  The CDC finally started speaking out and, *gasp,* contradicting the administration's messaging.  When the thing the administration really cares about (the stock market) starting getting sick, it started taking the problem seriously and has been giving, at least, some more honest assessments of the problem.\n\nIn the past two days, the administration seems be getting a little more coherent with reality.  Hopefully, they can keep it together long enough so that we feel less panicked, and normality sets in again.  That said, I think it is only a matter of time before they start the lie machine again and blaming everyone else.  They won't address any of the underlying issues.

He was in bed, recovering from something like a severe flu. (He had tested flu-negative, which was unusual \u2014 and what motivated her research.) They talked over email and WhatsApp and the phone about the grim situation evolving in Wuhan, China, where the virus originated.\n\n\u201cIn mid- to late January we started developing a plan for our family in case one of us became infected, and preparing supplies for two weeks of isolation,\u201d she said. They also started calculating the numbers and sharing frustrations over their inability to convey to people the seriousness of the coronavirus\u2019s exponential spread.\n\n\u201cWe were listening to people, such as President Trump, saying, \u2018What\u2019s the fuss, it\u2019s just like the flu,\u2019 and \u2018There are only 15 cases, and only one death in the U.S., much fewer than everywhere else, we\u2019re doing great,\u2019\u201d Dr. Nick Jewell said. \u201cBut every epidemiologist knew what was coming inexorably toward us.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, they noticed a [tweet by Mike Baker](https://twitter.com/bymikebaker/status/1237588549362278400?s=12) of The New York Times, in which he noted the cumulative number of coronavirus cases in the U.S. by date:\n\nJan. 14 \u2014 0\n\nJan. 21 \u2014 1\n\nJan. 28 \u2014 5\n\nFeb. 4 \u2014 11\n\nFeb. 11 \u2014 14\n\nFeb. 18 \u2014 25\n\nFeb. 25 \u2014 59\n\nMar. 3 \u2014 125\n\nMar. 10 \u2014 1,004\n\n\u201cThat is exponential growth,\u201d Dr. Nick Jewell said. (He noted that the latest increase was also likely a reflection of increased testing.)\n\n\u201cWe started discussing what actions to take in the face of exponential growth,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, we need to slow the rate of growth ([flatten the curve](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/science/coronavirus-curve-mitigation-infection.html)) through government and individual responses \u2014 effectively based on increased testing and heightened social distancing. But in order to accomplish that, we first need to convince people to take this outbreak seriously, which is no small task. It\u2019s as if humans can only think linearly. But for epidemic modelers, exponential growth is the very nature of the beast.\u201d\n\nDr. Britta Jewell wondered whether the power of exponential growth could be turned to a collective advantage. \u201cThe answer was yes, but only if we intervene early,\u201d she said. \u201cThat means now.\u201d\n\nThe exponential effect was now on other minds as well. Yaneer Bar-Yam, a physicist and systems scientist and the founding president of the New England Complex Systems Institute, convened a YouTube chat with Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a probability fl\u00e2neur and risk analyst, to discuss \u201c[Why It\u2019s Better to Panic Early](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=e2Kga5HeAqk),\u201d following up on [a paper](https://necsi.edu/systemic-risk-of-pandemic-via-novel-pathogens-coronavirus-a-note) they put out in late January.

Chu, an infectious disease expert in Seattle, knew that the United States did not have much time.\nIn late January, the first confirmed American case of the coronavirus had landed in her area. Critical questions needed answers: Had the man infected anyone else? Was the deadly virus already lurking in other communities and spreading?\nAs luck would have it, Dr. Chu had a way to monitor the region. For months, as part of a research project into the flu, she and a team of researchers had been collecting nasal swabs from residents experiencing symptoms throughout the Puget Sound region.\nTo repurpose the tests for monitoring the coronavirus, they would need the support of state and federal officials. But nearly everywhere Dr. Chu turned, officials repeatedly rejected the idea, interviews and emails show, even as weeks crawled by and outbreaks emerged in countries outside of China, where the infection began.\nBy Feb. 25, Dr. Chu and her colleagues could not bear to wait any longer. They began performing coronavirus tests, without government approval.\nWhat came back confirmed their worst fear. They quickly had a positive test from a local teenager with no recent travel history. The coronavirus had already established itself on American soil without anybody realizing it.\n\u201cIt must have been here this entire time,\u201d Dr. Chu recalled thinking with dread. \u201cIt\u2019s just everywhere already.\u201d\nIn fact, officials would later discover through testing, the virus had already contributed to the deaths of two people, and it would go on to kill 20 more in the Seattle region over the following days.\nFederal and state officials said the flu study could not be repurposed because it did not have explicit permission from research subjects; the labs were also not certified for clinical work. While acknowledging the ethical questions, Dr. Chu and others argued there should be more flexibility in an emergency during which so many lives could be lost. On Monday night, state regulators told them to stop testing altogether.\nThe failure to tap into the flu study, detailed here for the first time, was just one in a series of missed chances by the federal government to ensure more widespread testing during the early days of the outbreak, when containment would have been easier. Instead, local officials across the country were left to work blindly as the crisis grew undetected and exponentially.\nEven now, after weeks of mounting frustration toward federal agencies over flawed test kits and burdensome rules, states with growing cases such as New York and California are struggling to test widely for the coronavirus. The continued delays have made it impossible for officials to get a true picture of the scale of the growing outbreak, which has now spread to at least 36 states and Washington, D.C.\nDr. Robert R. Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview on Friday that acting quickly was critical for combating an outbreak. \u201cTime matters,\u201d he said.\nHe insisted that despite the rocky start, there was still time to beat back the coronavirus in the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take rigorous, aggressive public health \u2014 what I like to say, block and tackle, block and tackle, block and tackle, block and tackle,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means if you find a new case, you isolate it.\u201d\nBut the Seattle Flu Study illustrates how existing regulations and red tape \u2014 sometimes designed to protect privacy and health \u2014 have impeded the rapid rollout of testing nationally, while other countries ramped up much earlier and faster. Faced with a public health emergency on a scale potentially not seen in a century, the United States has not responded nimbly.\nThe C.D.C.\u2019s own effort to create a system for monitoring the virus around the country, using established government surveillance networks for the flu, has not yet built steam. And as late as last week, after expanding authorizations for commercial and academic institutions to make tests, administration officials provided conflicting accounts of when a significant increase in tests would be available.\nIn states like Maine, Missouri and Michigan, where there are few or no known infections, state public health officials say they have more than enough tests to meet demand.\nBut it remains unclear how many Americans have been tested for the coronavirus. The C.D.C. says approximately 8,500 specimens or nose swabs have been taken since the beginning of the outbreak \u2014 a figure that is almost certainly larger than the number of people tested since one person can have multiple swabs. By comparison, South Korea, which discovered its first case around the same time as the United States, has reported having the capacity to test roughly 10,000 people a day since late February.\nA prime mission\nAs soon as the genetic sequence of the coronavirus was published in January, the C.D.C.\u2019s first job was to develop a diagnostic test. \u201cThat\u2019s our prime mission,\u201d Dr. Redfield said, \u201cto get eyes on this thing.\u201d\nThe agency also released criteria for deciding which individuals should be tested for the virus \u2014 at first only those who had a fever and respiratory issues and had traveled from the outbreak\u2019s origin in Wuhan, China.\nThe criteria were so strict that the sick man in the Seattle area who had visited Wuhan did not meet it. Still, worried state health officials pushed to get him checked, and the C.D.C. agreed. Local officials sent a sample to Atlanta and the results came back positive.\nOfficials monitored 70 people who were in contact with the man, including 50 who consented to getting nose swabs, and none tested positive for the coronavirus. But there was still the possibility that someone had been missed, said Dr. Scott Lindquist, the state epidemiologist for communicable diseases.\nAround this time, the Washington State Department of Health began discussions with the Seattle Flu Study already going on in the state.\nBut there was a hitch: The flu project primarily used research laboratories, not clinical ones, and its coronavirus test was not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. And so the group was not certified to provide test results to anyone outside of their own investigators. They began discussions with state, C.D.C. and F.D.A. officials to figure out a solution, according to emails and interviews.\nDr. Scott F. Dowell, a former high-ranking C.D.C. official and a current deputy director at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, which funds the Seattle Flu Study, asked for help from the leaders of the C.D.C.\u2019s coronavirus response. \u201cHoping there is a solution,\u201d he wrote on Feb. 10.\nLater, Dr. Lindquist, the state epidemiologist in Washington, wrote an email to Dr. Alicia Fry, the chief of the C.D.C.\u2019s epidemiology and prevention branch, requesting the study be used to test for the coronavirus.\nC.D.C. officials repeatedly said it would not be possible. \u201cIf you want to use your test as a screening tool, you would have to check with F.D.A.,\u201d Gayle Langley, an officer at the C.D.C.\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, wrote back in an email on Feb. 16. But the F.D.A. could not offer the approval because the lab was not certified as a clinical laboratory under regulations established by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, a process that could take months.\nDr. Chu and Dr. Lindquist tried repeatedly to wrangle approval to use the Seattle Flu Study. The answers were always no.\n\u201cWe felt like we were sitting, waiting for the pandemic to emerge,\u201d Dr. Chu said. \u201cWe could help. We couldn\u2019t do anything.\u201d", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1583892806, "author": "saberhyperlooper", "link_id": "t3_fgpjsg", "parent_id": "t3_fgpjsg", "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": true, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "ffsp0kv": {"body": "SHANGHAI \u2014 Recently, someone following the coronavirus crisis through China\u2019s official news media would see lots of footage, often set to stirring music, praising the heroism and sacrifice of health workers marching off to stricken places.\n\nBut someone following the crisis through social media would see something else entirely: vitriolic comments and mocking memes about government officials, harrowing descriptions of untreated family members and images of hospital corridors loaded with patients, some of whom appear to be dead.\n\nThe contrast is almost never so stark in China. The government usually keeps a tight grip on what is said, seen and heard about it. But the sheer amount of criticism \u2014 and the often clever ways in which critics dodge censors, such as by referring to Xi Jinping, China\u2019s top leader, as \u201cTrump\u201d or by comparing the outbreak to the Chernobyl catastrophe \u2014 have made it difficult for Beijing to control the message.\n\nIn recent days, critics have pounced when officials in the city of Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, wore their protective masks incorrectly. They have heaped scorn upon stumbling pronouncements. When Wuhan\u2019s mayor spoke to official media on Monday, one commenter responded, \u201cIf the virus is fair, then please don\u2019t spare this useless person.\u201d\n\nThe condemnations stand as a rare direct challenge to the Communist Party, which brooks no dissent in the way it runs China. In some cases, Chinese leaders appear to be acknowledging people\u2019s fear, anger and other all-too-human reactions to the crisis, showing how the party can move dramatically, if sometimes belatedly, to mollify the public.\n\nSuch criticism can go only so far, however. Some of China\u2019s more commercially minded media outlets have covered the disease and the response thoroughly if not critically. But articles and comments about the virus continue to be deleted, and the government and internet platforms have issued fresh warnings against spreading what they call \u201crumors.\u201d\n\n\u201cChinese social media are full of anger, not because there was no censorship on this topic, but despite strong censorship,\u201d said Xiao Qiang, a research scientist at the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley, and the founder of China Digital Times, a website that monitors Chinese internet controls. \u201cIt is still possible that the censorship will suddenly increase again, as part of an effort to control the narrative.\u201d\n\nWhen China\u2019s leaders battled the SARS virus in the early 2000s, social media was only just beginning to blossom in the country. The government covered up the disease\u2019s spread, and it was left to journalists and other critics to shame the authorities into acknowledging the scale of the problem.\n\nToday, smartphones and social media make it harder for mass public health crises to stay buried. But internet platforms in China are just as easily polluted with false and fast-moving information as they are everywhere else. During outbreaks of disease, Beijing\u2019s leaders have legitimate reason to be on alert for quack remedies and scaremongering fabrications, which can cause panic and do damage.\n\nIn recent days, though, Beijing seems to be reasserting its primacy over information in ways that go beyond mere rumor control. At a meeting this past weekend between Mr. Xi and other senior leaders, one of the measures they resolved to take against the virus was to \u201cstrengthen the guidance of public opinion.\u201d\n\nWang Huning, the head of the Communist Party\u2019s publicity department and an influential party ideologue, was also recently named deputy head of the team in charge of containing the outbreak, behind only China\u2019s premier, Li Keqiang.\n\nChinese officials seem to recognize that social media can be a useful tool for feeling out public opinion in times of crisis. WeChat, the popular Chinese messaging platform, said over the weekend that it would crack down hard on rumors about the virus. But it also created a tool for users to report tips and information about the disease and the response.\n\nInternet backlash may already have caused one local government in China to change course on its virus-fighting policies. The southern city of Shantou announced on Sunday that it was stopping cars, ships and people from entering the city, in a policy that echoed ones in Wuhan. But then word went around that the decision had led people to panic-buy food, and by the afternoon, the order had been rescinded.\n\nNowhere has the local government been the target of more internet vitriol than in Hubei Province, where Wuhan is the capital.\n\nAfter the Hubei governor, Wang Xiaodong, and other officials there gave a news briefing on Sunday, web users mocked Mr. Wang for misstating, twice, the number of face masks that the province could produce. They circulated a photo from the briefing of him and two other officials, pointing out that one of them did not cover his nose with his mask, that another wore his mask upside down and that Mr. Wang did not wear a mask at all.\n\nOn Monday, social media users were similarly unrelenting toward Wuhan\u2019s mayor, Zhou Xianwang.During an interview Mr. Zhou gave to state television, commenters in live streams unloaded on him, with one writing: \u201cStop talking. We just want to know when you will resign.\u201dTop authorities may be deliberately directing public anger toward officials in Hubei and Wuhan as a prelude to their resigning and being replaced. Many other targets within the Chinese leadership seem to remain off limits.This month, as news of the coronavirus emerged but Mr. Xi did not make public appearances to address it, people on the social platform Weibo began venting their frustration in veiled ways, asking, \u201cWhere\u2019s that person?\u201d\n\nBut even those comments were deleted. So some users started replacing Mr. Xi\u2019s name with \u201cTrump.\u201d As in, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go through another minute of this year, my heart is filled with pain, I hope Trump dies.\u201d\n\nOther people hungering to express frustration have taken to the Chinese social platform Douban, which has been flooded recently by user reviews for \u201cChernobyl,\u201d the hit television series about the Soviet nuclear disaster.\n\n\u201cIn any era, any country, it\u2019s the same. Cover everything up,\u201d one reviewer wrote on Monday.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s socialism,\u201d wrote another.\n\nSome Chinese news outlets have been able to report incisively on the coronavirus. The influential newsmagazine Caixin has put out rigorous reporting and analysis. The Paper, a digital news outlet that is overseen by Shanghai\u2019s Communist Party Committee, published a chilling video about a Wuhan resident who couldn\u2019t find a hospital that would treat him and ended up wandering the streets.\n\nMr. Xiao, the Chinese internet expert, said the central authorities long gave such outlets special leeway to cover certain topics in ways that official media cannot. But the outlets should not be viewed as independent of the government, he said, calling their coverage \u201cplanned and controlled publicity\u201d from the authorities.\n\nEven outside the digital realm, it is not hard to find people in China who remain unsure of whether to trust what their government is telling them about the outbreak.\n\nChen Pulin, a 78-year-old retiree, was waiting outside a Shanghai hospital recently while his daughter was inside being tested for the virus. When word of the disease first began trickling out, he immediately had doubts about whether officials were being forthcoming about it.\n\n\u201cEven now, the government seems to be thinking about the economy and social stability,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cThose things are important, but when it comes to these infectious diseases, stopping the disease should come first.\u201d\n\nLi Yuan contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

Some Johor Bahru eateries feel the pinch as fewer Singaporeans travel across the Causeway\n\n&gt; Food establishments in Johor Bahru are reporting a decline in sales of up to 70 per cent.\n\n&gt; JOHOR BAHRU: Food eateries in Johor Bahru that usually see many customers from across the causeway are reeling from a sharp decline in sales, amid fears over the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n&gt; Restaurants and outlets interviewed by CNA said that the steep drop in business has been evident since Chinese New Year, when Johor reported its first confirmed case of the virus.\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; Among the affected businesses is Hiap Joo Bakery &amp; Biscuit Factory, known for its banana cakes. The bakery typically attracts a line of customers outside its doors near Jalan Dhoby.\n\n&gt; Following the outbreak, sales has dipped by at least 50 per cent, said Mr Lim Toh Shin who runs the bakery\u2019s operations.\n\n&gt; File photo for Hiap Joo Bakery at Johor Bahru. (Photo: Amir Yusof)\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; \u201cThere is usually a long queue for our cakes at 11am every day, but these days, the line will only last for five minutes,\u201d said Mr Lim.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe now have excess cakes and are unable to sell all that we bake for the day,\u201d he added.\n\n&gt; \"VIRTUAL GHOST TOWN\"\n\n&gt; Mr Lim estimates that Singaporeans typically make up more than half of his total customer base, and the sharp decline recently can be attributed to fewer Singapore visitors.\n\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s clear because there are markedly fewer visitors on weekends, when most of our customers from Singapore usually come and buy,\u201d he said.\n\n&gt; Meanwhile along the same street, Mr Rahim Khan, operator of Salahuddin Bakery echoed similar sentiments.\n\n&gt; Salahuddin Bakery sells freshly baked curry puffs and French loaves. Mr Khan said that business has slowed down by 40 to 50 per cent recently.\n\n&gt; Salahuddin bakery along Jalan Dhoby, (Photo: Amir Yusof)\n\n&gt; He attributed the fall in sales to people's fear that they might catch the virus if they travel.\n\n&gt; \u201cI can understand the fear. Some of my regular customers from Singapore called and apologised that they are unable to come, but I understand. It would not be worth the journey if they become sick,\u201d he added.\n\n&gt; Both bakeries are located near Jalan Dhoby in downtown Johor Bahru. The area is well known for its hipster cafes, traditional Chinese restaurants and classic bakeries. It is a hotspot for Singaporean visitors.\n\n&gt; But recently, the place has become a \u201cvirtual ghost town\u201d said Mr Khan.\n\n&gt; Although the pedestrian walkkway near Jalan Dhoby has been recently expanded, the foot traffic is low because of the spread of the coronavirus. (Photo: Amir Yusof)\n\n&gt; He added: \u201cThe virus is definitely to blame. But also, we are suffering now because there has been some construction work to widen pedestrian walkways. This makes it hard for our customers to park\u201d.\n\n&gt; There have been 22 cases of COVID-19 in Malaysia, with 17 people discharged so far.\n\n&gt; LESS CAUSEWAY CONGESTION\n\n&gt; According to media reports, there has been less congestion at the Causeway over the past few weeks.\n\n&gt; On Thursday (Feb 20) evening, the journey from Woodlands Checkpoint to Johor Bahru via the Causeway took around 20 mins, based on what CNA experienced.

Health care workers who wear N95 masks as part of their jobs are required to undergo a fit test at least once a year to ensure that there are no gaps around their mouths.\n\n&gt;Most people are unlikely to know how to wear these masks and could accidentally contaminate themselves if they touch the outside of the mask when they remove it and then touch their face.\n\n&gt;\u201cNot having a mask does not necessarily put you at any increased risk of contracting this disease,\u201d Dr. Ryan said.\n\n&gt;But the message has not stopped people from buying the masks, particularly the N95s, which are usually inexpensive and popular with construction workers and painters.\n\n&gt;\u201cYou know what a mask costs?\u201d said Mike Bowen, the executive vice president of Prestige Ameritech, an N95 mask manufacturer in North Richland Hills, Texas. \u201cListen to this: A Class 2 medical device, you can buy two of them for the price of a gumball.\u201d\n\n&gt;He added: \u201cThey\u2019re cheap.

On February 25th, the South Korean government accused the Vietnamese government of quarantining 20 Korean nationals from Daegu to Vietnam without prior notice in the middle of a pandemic, when the number of cases in South Korea was in the 800. The South Korean media subsequently labeling countries (with special focus on Vietnam) that have imposed travel restriction on travelers from South Korea \u201cKoreaphobic\u201d despite anyone with eyes can see that the epidemic was blowing up fast in South Korea, and the South Korea government still hadn\u2019t restricted travel for its nationals within the country and to other countries. In comparison, despite China\u2019s initially putting pressure on countries that had put a travel ban on travelers from China, China\u2019s response and travel ban of its citizens to other countries, even if a bit late, was downright charitable.\n\nTo sum up part 1: The South Korean government\u2019s lack of containment measures when things start to go off the rail made the epidemic uncontainable now, and the 4 alarm bells within 2 weeks didn\u2019t work.\n\nII.

The church had a presence in Wuhan.\n\nKwon Jun-wook, a KCDC official, confirmed for the first time that some members of the church visited Wuhan during a briefing. He said it was unclear how many went there and whether the trip played a role in the outbreak.\"\n\nEmphasis mine.\n\nPatient 29, 30, and 31 were all community cases who got infected from someone else around the end of Jan and beginning of Feb. Assuming that they were only the second link in a chain and not somewhere further down, we can see that the people who infected them were infected by end of Jan at the latest estimation, when there was 17 000 infected cases in Hubei, the Chinese authorities hadn\u2019t enacted lockdown on Hubei and prevented Chinese nationals from going to other countries on tours, and the South Korean government didn\u2019t even enact quarantine on all travelers from China. Even if a member of Shincheonji travelling from Wuhan was the only patient 0, the only reason why they would managed to get in and spread the disease undetected in South Korea was because the South Korean government refused to enact proper preventative measures and waited for China to do it for them. And judging from the 4 different alarm bells within 2 weeks, either there wasn\u2019t only 1 patient 0 or there was a super spreader patient 0 undetected. Further genetic testing of the viral strains within the infected population can determine exactly which scenario it was, but as of now, I haven\u2019t come across such report.\n\nTo sum up part 2: The preventative measures to prevent the epidemic from entering the country were either lacking or done poorly, in line with the subsequent poor containment measures and failure to put out the epidemic quickly due to inherent structural problems.", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1583309770, "author": "byebyebyd", "link_id": "t3_fd6m35", "parent_id": "t1_fjg3ffy", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fkz51iu": {"body": "10% is really high, but it isn't high enough to cause itself to blow out. I never said it wasn't high, just said that wasn't the reason it blew out.

R0 of 3, 14 transmissible days before death, and 10% fatality rate will spread easily if you don't isolate it. All the 10% did was make it serious enough we isolated every single case ASAP, meaning the average days transmissible before isolation per case was something like 2 in 2003, so we got the new cases per case underneath 1. That's all that matters for spread - is the average case creating more and less than 1 more case? Before public health measures were implemented, the R0 of 2003 SARS was about 3. It was spreading just fine with a 10% fatality rate. After public health measures were implemented, the R0 fell to 0.4.\n\nCOVID is transmissible asymptomatically and doesn't result in hospitalization in the majority of cases, meaning the average transmissible days in contact with the public closer to 10. That's a *much* bigger difference regarding *spread* of the virus than a 1% vs 3% vs 10% death rate. Each case is causing more than 1 more case right now and that happened too fast for us to get a handle on it. Even if the COVID death rate was 10%, it would still be spreading at an R0 above 1 with current behavior. (Maybe we would've taken isolation more seriously and changed behavior earlier, but that's a different discussion - nothing intrinsic to the virus itself would cause R0 to drop from 3 to below 1 by rising to a 10% death rate).\n\nFrom a current stage in the pandemic perspective we need testing yes, but on an individual case basis, the reason SARS didn't explode is because it was very easy to contain, not because it was fatal enough that it petered out in community spread anyways.

However, detailed molecular mechanisms for ADE of coronavirus entry are still unknown.\n\nhttps://jvi.asm.org/content/94/5/e02015-19.long\n\nWhat it might mean in practice:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; It\u2019s highly possible to get infected a second time,\u201d one of the doctors, who declined to be identified, told the outlet.\n&gt; \n&gt; The physician said that medication used to treat the virus can have negative side effects on patients\u2019 heart tissue, making them more susceptible to cardiac arrest.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cA few people recovered from the first time by their own immune system, but the meds [sic] they use are damaging their heart tissue, and **when they get it the second time, the antibody doesn\u2019t help but makes it worse**, and they die a sudden death from heart failure,\u201d the doctor said.\n\nhttps://nypost.com/2020/02/19/whistleblower-doctors-say-coronavirus-reinfection-even-deadlier/amp/?__twitter_impression=true&amp;utm_source=reddit.com", "subreddit": "Covid2019", "created_utc": 1582312363, "author": "tadskis", "link_id": "t3_f7b8fx", "parent_id": "t1_fiao83q", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": true, "surprise": true, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fkim5dr": {"body": "&gt;Kushner entered into a crisis management process that, despite the triumphant and self-congratulatory tone of public briefings, was as haphazard and helter-skelter as the chaotic early days of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 turning into something of a family-and-friends pandemic response operation.\n\nI always feel better when Uday and Qusay get involved.\n\n&gt;Kushner rushed to help write Trump\u2019s widely panned Oval Office address to the nation. His supermodel sister-in-law\u2019s father, Kurt Kloss, an emergency room doctor, crowdsourced suggestions from his Facebook network to pass along to Kushner.\n\nThey've hollowed out the federal government so badly this is what we're left with.\n\n&gt;The scramble for solutions is occurring in an overriding atmosphere of trepidation of saying something that Trump might perceive as disloyal and of fear that their fumbles could cost the president his reelection in November.\n\n&gt;\u201cThe problem is no one is sure who is in charge,\u201d a senior administration official said. \u201cUnless someone comes to you and says, \u2018I was with the president five minutes ago,\u2019 and you know they\u2019re telling the truth, getting irreversible direction is a little difficult.\u201d\n\nTrump's reign of terror \"management\" style in action.\n\n&gt;Graham said that after speaking Friday night with Trump and Kushner, as well as first lady Melania Trump, the president had gotten past some of his frustrations with news coverage of the coronavirus and was \u201call in\u201d on developing mitigation plans. \n\nGood news! The president promises, for real this time, that he'll no longer sabotage the nation's response to the pandemic! What a victory.\n\n&gt; Each day \u2014 including some weekends \u2014 Pence convenes an afternoon meeting of roughly 20 officials in the White House Situation Room, and about 10 more in an overflow room.\n\n&gt;The task force meetings often last about 2 \u00bd hours. At best, they have been forums to suggest and debate a broad range of ideas, from disease mitigation to public communications. At worst, they have been dens of discord, with officials with varying portfolios feuding over policy or even simply power and position. The mood has turned especially tense over frustrations with testing delays.\n\n&gt;Few decisions are made in these meetings, however. Trump has only occasionally attended, usually when Pence requests his time. Neither Kushner nor his wife, Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and also a senior White House adviser, has attended \u2014 though Kushner\u2019s focus is now on the coronavirus and he has assembled many of his allies in the government to assist.\n\nIf The Family isn't there, nothing gets done. \n\n&gt;Trump is between chiefs of staff \u2014 acting chief Mick Mulvaney is transitioning out while Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) prepares to replace him \u2014 and the lack of a forceful gatekeeper has led to the president conducting decision-making as he prefers: With upward of a half-dozen aides and advisers in the Oval Office, all scrambling to perform for him as they await his decisions, which sometimes depend on his mood.\n\nJesters performing to the mad king's delight or anger. \n\nThis is your government in action. Note the complete lack of adult agency, the dearth of expertise and preparation. Just chaos, government by nepotism, and fear of enraging a lunatic.\n\n&gt;Although Trump is the final decision-maker, as his aides are quick to remind people, a number of principals \u2014 including Pence, Kushner, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, Domestic Policy Council Director Joe Grogan and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield \u2014 operate as power centers with their own fiefdoms. They compete with one another over ideas, often developed by their own staffs, and at times move to undercut rivals in meetings.\n\nMore than half of those (Pence, Kushner, Kudlow, Azar) are completely incompetent and/or do not believe in reality-based science. I don't know about the other two.\n\n&gt;Senior officials and members of the task force also said they have to spend significant chunks of their day dealing with leaks, especially as officials try to escape blame for the testing issues that have plagued the administration\u2019s response for weeks.\n\n&gt;Among those seeking to avoid such blame is the president himself. Asked at Friday\u2019s news conference whether he accepts responsibility for the continued shortage of test kits, Trump said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t take responsibility at all.\u201d\n\n\"I don't take responsibility at all\" is what all levels of the government are working on.", "subreddit": "politics", "created_utc": 1584223272, "author": "technical_assistance", "link_id": "t3_fiq0g1", "parent_id": "t3_fiq0g1", "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": true, "disgust": true, "fear": true, "joy": true, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": true, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fj6y9k2": {"body": "I had this guy in a white dodge caravan drive up to me while I was out of my mind last summer thinking the world was going to end soon, and he told me his name was death.

Airbnb Inc. said no.\n\nThe San Francisco-based startup said the family didn\u2019t qualify for a refund under its new \u201cextenuating circumstances\u201d coronavirus policy, which only applies to China, Italy and South Korea. The home-share company\u2019s official response to the family refers to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: \u201cIf the CDC\u2019s precautions are followed, you could safely travel to Japan.\u201d\n\nOstroff was shocked. \u201cI repeatedly asked about bringing a child into this situation and they did not answer,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like Airbnb is being recklessly irresponsible here.\u201d\n\nAirbnb, which was founded in 2008 during the financial crisis as a cheaper alternative to hotels, is confronting a second major challenge in the coronavirus. The stakes are higher than ever this time around because this is the year Airbnb wants to debut on the stock market. And with more than 7 million listings across the globe and a private market valuation of $31 billion, Airbnb\u2019s reputation has never mattered more or been under more scrutiny.\n\nThe Covid-19 virus, which is now active in more than 100 countries, has hit the travel industry hard. Some airlines have canceled flights to certain countries, hotels have closed and the some of the biggest conferences of the year have been scrapped. Many companies have forbidden international travel and told staff to work from home. On Monday, Booking Holdings Inc., the world\u2019s largest online travel-booking site, withdrew its already bleak first-quarter guidance, citing the worsening impact of the coronavirus.\n\nNavigating the global outbreak is trickier for Airbnb than for big hotel chains or airlines who serve only travelers and manage all of their inventory. Airbnb is a two-way platform, connecting people who want to rent out all or part of their home with travelers seeking accommodations. For every guest cancellation the company approves there is a host at the other end who winds up out of pocket.\n\nIn its drive to balance the needs of hosts, who sometimes get their entire income from listing property on the site, against travelers\u2019 concerns, Airbnb -- at least for now -- is putting the onus on hosts to be accommodating, such as by offering refunds or loosening cancellation policies. But that\u2019s leaving a lot of travelers disgruntled and feeling like they\u2019re footing the bill for stays they had no choice but to cancel.\n\nSmart companies strive to protect their reputations, especially when bad things happen outside their control, said Micah Solomon, a customer service expert and author of the book Ignore Your Customers And They\u2019ll Go Away. \u201cThis crisis is going to be over sometime,\u201d he said, and when it\u2019s over \u201cyou still want to be the go-to place for guests.\u201d\n\nRight now not many guests want to be at an Airbnb. Angry travelers have flooded Twitter with complaints over what many are calling a lack of compassion during a global health emergency. Users have vented about four-day waits to speak to a real person and said the company\u2019s policies are implicitly encouraging them to put their health at risk. One user wrote: \u201cLooks like we have to actually get covid-19 to get a 100% refund from @Airbnb. Talk about mixed incentives.\u201d Another said: \u201cNo corporate social responsibility? You\u2019re forcing people to take their trips and possibly spread COVID.\u201d\n\nPart of the problem stems from Airbnb\u2019s shared responsibility with hosts on refunds. Airbnb will give a full refund within the first 48 hours after a guest books a site. After that, it\u2019s up to hosts to set how much of a refund they\u2019re willing to offer. These policies, outlined on each individual listing, can range from very flexible, offering free cancellation up to a day before, to very strict no refund whatsoever. Airbnb says hosts offer flexible and moderate cancellation policies on more than 60% of current listings.\n\nIn Ostroff\u2019s case, he had booked three Airbnb\u2019s for the trip to Japan and got three very different responses to his refund requests. The first host granted a full refund, but Airbnb still pocketed a $125 service fee from the reservation. The second host refused any refund and the third simply never replied. In all, the family lost more than $1,000.\n\nAfter being made aware of the Ostroff\u2019s situation by Bloomberg, Airbnb offered the family a full refund.\n\nAirbnb said not all of its guests are angry. \u201cWe have heard from many guests who appreciate that their hosts have been flexible and helped them rearrange or cancel their travel plans with no penalty,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nMany U.S. companies are basing their policies on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the national public health institute. The CDC rates Japan an alert level 2, and recommends older adults and those with chronic medical conditions consider postponing nonessential travel there. But the country is taking more drastic action. Schools, museums and sporting events have been canceled, and the Hokkaido region has declared a state of emergency. The government is advising against being in crowds.\n\nTravel companies have varying responses to requests for refunds. Expedia Group Inc.\u2019s vacation-rental site VRBO hasn\u2019t extended its cancellation or refund policy for guests impacted by the virus. The company\u2019s Book with Confidence Guarantee only protects guests from fraudulent listings and misrepresentation. \u201cIt does not cover cancellations due to travel advisories from force majeure,\u201d meaning unforeseeable circumstances beyond its control, Expedia said in a statement. Marriott International Inc. is waiving cancellation fees for stays through March 31 for travel to or from several countries in Asia and Italy.\n\nOn Tuesday, Airbnb updated its policies to offer hosts more tools to grant refunds and, in turn, allow guests to postpone travel plans. It will reward hosts who are willing to be flexible on refunds by giving their listings more visibility and scrapping the 3% fee it typically charges. The company also offered to return its service fee to guests as a coupon to be used on future bookings if trips have to be canceled due to coronavirus.\n\n\u201cTravel on Airbnb is powered by people, not large corporations,\u201d Airbnb\u2019s head of homes Greg Greeley said in a statement. Because of Airbnb\u2019s \u201ctwo-sided model, when a crisis like Covid-19 hits, we know that it doesn\u2019t just impact us as a company, but also the individual stakeholders within our community: the hosts who rely on their Airbnb income, and guests who have their travel plans disrupted.\u201d Airbnb is \u201ccommitted to doing everything we can to fairly support both parties, consistent with how this two-sided marketplace works,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile gearing up for its public listing, Airbnb has been spending more on marketing and new safety features, causing the company to swing to a loss in 2019 after two years of profit before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to understand why they\u2019re being very prudent with refunds,\u201d said Bradley Tusk, a venture capitalist who advises technology companies in crisis, though has never worked with Airbnb. But, warned that the company risked hurting its brand as it edges closer to a listing. (Tusk also ran the 2009 mayoral campaign of Michael Bloomberg, the owner of Bloomberg LP.)\n\nAirbnb\u2019s updated policy does little for travelers like the Ostroff\u2019s, and others who have had to cancel or postpone trips to the 97 or so countries not covered by the company\u2019s extenuating circumstances policy. Nor does it help those who were planning to attend public events that have since been scrapped.\n\nWilliam Matchin was traveling from South Carolina to Massachusetts for two psychology conferences this month. Both were canceled due to the virus and Airbnb declined to give him a refund. \u201cIt took forever to get on the phone with them and basically they just said go and talk to the host and try to get a refund from them,\u201d Matchin said. \u201cThis is such a stark contrast to hotels and airlines which have issued automatic refunds no questions asked.

The nurses helped to get them dumplings on Chinese New Year\u2019s Eve to help them fulfil a Chinese tradition signifying the changing of years, and also gave them treats such as home-made soup.\n\n&gt; Now that they have recovered, they will spend a few days recuperating here before heading back to Wuhan.\n\n&gt; Mr Wang said: \u201cI had bak kut teh before, and I liked it.

Boundaries were sourced from the 2018 U.S. Census.\n* If it detects you are not in an infection zone, it calculates the closest infected county from you and displays it on the map, including how far away it is and how many cases/deaths the area has.\n* As more and more counties are added to the map, it may take more time to calculate this. I'm planning to switch to a faster algorithm soon so this won't be a problem.\n* Minified data payloads to improve site load times\n* Added a running 24-hour change for nationwide number of cases/deaths/recovered.\n* Added log scale option so we can better visualize the cases/deaths on the same chart &amp; analyze the trend of growth.\n* Added map legend with 6 colors and ranges.

Didn\u2019t think about the paywall. Here\u2019s the text:\n\n\nI have the coronavirus. And it hasn\u2019t been that bad.\nI am in my late 60s, and the sickest I\u2019ve ever been was when I had bronchitis several years ago. That laid me out on my back for a few days. This has been much easier: no chills, no body aches. I breathe easily, and I don\u2019t have a stuffy nose. My chest feels tight, and I have coughing spells. If I were at home with similar symptoms, I probably would have gone to work as usual.\nI caught the virus on the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship that was quarantined outside Yokohama for 14 days, at the end of a 16-day cruise I took with my wife, Jeri. When I left the ship a couple of weeks ago, I felt fine. We checked our temperatures throughout our quarantine. Jeri and I got a swab test for the virus. Our temperatures were normal; they\u2019d get the swab results back in 48 hours. Our test results had not arrived before we boarded buses for the airport, where two U.S. government planes waited for us.\nAs we took off from Tokyo, I had a bit of a cough, but I chalked it up to the dry air in the cabin. I felt pretty tired \u2014 but who wouldn\u2019t, in our situation? I dozed off.\nWhen I woke up, I had a fever. I made my way to the back of the cargo plane, where the Air Force had set up a quarantine area cordoned off with sheets of plastic. They took my temperature. It was over 103 degrees. So I took a seat in the quarantine area and fell back asleep until we touched down in California, at Travis Air Force Base.Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention came onto the plane and said that three of us who had been cordoned off would fly to Omaha (with our spouses, if they wanted to come along). The CDC had a quarantine location at the University of Nebraska\u2019s hospital. We arrived on Feb. 17, greeted by a fleet of ambulances and police cars. Officials put me on a stretcher and wheeled me into a van, which made for a very dramatic scene. I easily could have walked myself, despite my exhaustion.On the hospital campus, they put me in a biocontainment unit. The space was sealed off, with two double-paned windows that looked out on the hallway, and a large, heavy, insulated door. Two cameras watched me at all times; a set of computer monitors were equipped with microphones, so that the medical staff and I could communicate with CDC officials at central command down the hall. The room had last been used for the Ebola outbreak in 2014.While there is no vaccine for coronavirus, preventive steps and awareness are the best tools to prepare and protect yourself in the event of an outbreak.  A doctor and nurses reviewed my case with me and took a bunch of lab tests. They wore heavy-duty hazmat suits sealed with duct tape and equipped with motors that helped with air circulation. It looked like something out of \u201cThe Andromeda Strain.\u201d When the test came back a few hours later, I wasn\u2019t surprised to learn that I had the coronavirus. Later, the Tokyo swab confirmed the result \u2014 I had caught the virus even before I left the ship.\nIt didn\u2019t scare me too badly. I knew my number was up. The way I saw it, I was going to get stuck in at least 14 more days of quarantine, even if I didn\u2019t get the virus. So many fellow passengers had come down with the illness, including one of my friends, that I\u2019d gotten somewhat used to the idea that I might catch it, too. My wife, however, tested negative and headed to quarantine at a separate facility a few blocks away. After those days being cooped up on the ship together, I think we both relished the alone time; we still could communicate through our phones.\nDuring the first few days, the hospital staff hooked me up to an IV, mostly as a precaution, and used it to administer magnesium and potassium, just to make sure I had plenty of vitamins. Other than that, my treatment has consisted of what felt like gallons and gallons of Gatorade \u2014 and, when my fever rose just above 100 degrees, some ibuprofen. The nurses came to the room every four hours or so, to check my vitals, ask if I needed anything and to draw my blood. I got very good at unhooking all the monitors checking my oxygen level, blood pressure and heart rate so I could go to the bathroom or just pace around the room a little, to get my blood flowing. I never quite got the hang of hooking them back up without making a tangled mess. After 10 days, I moved out of biocontainment and into the same facility as Jeri. Now we can videochat from our separate quarantines, in neighboring rooms.As of my most recent test, on Thursday, I am still testing positive for the virus. But by now, I don\u2019t require much medical care. The nurses check my temperature twice a day and draw my blood, because I\u2019ve agreed to participate in a clinical study to try to find a treatment for coronavirus. If I test negative three days in a row, then I get to leave.\nThe time has passed more quickly than I would\u2019ve expected. With my laptop, I get as much work done as I can, remotely. I catch up with friends. I take walks around my room, trying to take a thousand more steps each day. I also watch the news. It\u2019s surreal to see everyone panic \u2014 news conferences, the stock market falling, school closures \u2014 about a disease I have. It does seem likely that coronavirus will spread in the United States, but it won\u2019t help anybody if we all panic. It\u2019s true that the disease seems much more likely to be fatal for older people and those in poor health. I\u2019m relatively fortunate: I\u2019m still younger than the most at-risk groups, and I\u2019m in good shape, giving me less cause for alarm. Others who contract the virus won\u2019t be as lucky. At least six Diamond Princess passengers have died from the disease, of around 705 passengers who caught it.Still, coronavirus doesn\u2019t have to be a horrible calamity. Based on my experience, I\u2019d recommend that everyone get a good digital thermometer, just as a comfort tool, so they can reassure themselves if their noses start running.\nIf you told me when I left home in January that I wouldn\u2019t be back until March \u2014 that, instead, I would be confined for more than 24 days because I\u2019d catch a novel virus at the center of what could become a pandemic \u2014 that would have completely freaked me out. But now that it\u2019s happening, I\u2019m just taking it one day at a time.As told to Post editor Sophia Nguyen.", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1582987288, "author": "PhilConnorsRemembers", "link_id": "t3_fbddme", "parent_id": "t3_fbddme", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": true, "pessimism": false, "sadness": true, "surprise": true, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fjhvacr": {"body": "Another big reason for why it's imperative to support Bernie is the *necessity* to defeat a President who is supporting the caging of kids and separation of families and making life for all of us more dangerous by actually suprressing information on the COVID-19 virus while his *own* medical advisors have to constantly contradict what he is saying.\n\nAnd in order to defeat the immense rabid fanboying from Trump's base, we need a nominee with a movement at his back who will actually go out and advocate for what is needed rather than just sitting in nicely decorated rooms and signing checks in the hopes of it happeneing.\n\nDonating hard earned money and depriving yourself of free time to volunteer for a campaign requires that you are motivated to do so. Even the most well-meaning person will not last long trying to support a campaign that they don't really believe in. They would still vote against Trump, but the difference that volunteering can make in terms of convincing other people around you to also support your candidate is huge. There is only one candidate where I see this level of motivation being sustained in a way that will really, truly make a difference. And that difference will absolutely affect downballot races as well.\n\nThere is also a time for moderation and a time for courage, so I want to share with you a passage from a famous letter written by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr about the concept of being a moderate:\n\n&gt; First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to \"order\" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: \"I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action\"; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a \"more convenient season.\" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.\n\nThe full essay/letter here: https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html\n\nI also want to share with you a passage from Barack Obama's book \"Audacity of Hope\" that highlights the corrupting influence of money and campaign finance fundraisers from wealthy donors on personal principles:\n\n&gt; I can\u2019t assume that the money chase didn\u2019t alter me in some ways. \u2026\n\n&gt; Increasingly I found myself spending time with people of means \u2014 law firm partners and investment bankers, hedge fund managers and venture capitalists. As a rule, they were smart, interesting people, knowledgeable about public policy, liberal in their politics, expecting nothing more than a hearing of their opinions in exchange for their checks. But they reflected, almost uniformly, the perspectives of their class: the top 1 percent or so of the income scale that can afford to write a $2,000 check to a political candidate. They believed in the free market and an educational meritocracy; they found it hard to imagine that there might be any social ill that could not be cured by a high SAT score. They had no patience with protectionism, found unions troublesome, and were not particularly sympathetic to those whose lives were upended by the movements of global capital. Most were adamantly prochoice and antigun and were vaguely suspicious of deep religious sentiment.\n\n&gt; And although my own worldview and theirs corresponded in many ways \u2014 I had gone to the same schools, after all, had read the same books, and worried about my kids in many of the same ways \u2014 I found myself avoiding certain topics during conversations with them, papering over possible differences, anticipating their expectations. On core issues I was candid; I had no problem telling well-heeled supporters that the tax cuts they\u2019d received from George Bush should be reversed. Whenever I could, I would try to share with them some of the perspectives I was hearing from other portions of the electorate: the legitimate role of faith in politics, say, or the deep cultural meaning of guns in rural parts of the state.\n\n&gt; Still, I know that as a consequence of my fund-raising I became more like the wealthy donors I met, in the very particular sense that I spent more and more of my time above the fray, outside the world of immediate hunger, disappointment, fear, irrationality, and frequent hardship of the other 99 percent of the population \u2014 that is, the people that I\u2019d entered public life to serve. And in one fashion or another, I suspect this is true for every senator: The longer you are a senator, the narrower the scope of your interactions. You may fight it, with town hall meetings and listening tours and stops by the old neighborhood. But your schedule dictates that you move in a different orbit from most of the people you represent.\n\n&gt; And perhaps as the next race approaches, a voice within tells you that you don\u2019t want to have to go through all the misery of raising all that money in small increments all over again. You realize that you no longer have the cachet you did as the upstart, the fresh face; you haven\u2019t changed Washington, and you\u2019ve made a lot of people unhappy with difficult votes. The path of least resistance \u2014 of fund-raisers organized by the special interests, the corporate PACs, and the top lobbying shops \u2014 starts to look awfully tempting, and if the opinions of these insiders don\u2019t quite jibe with those you once held, you learn to rationalize the changes as a matter of realism, of compromise, of learning the ropes. The problems of ordinary people, the voices of the Rust Belt town or the dwindling heartland, become a distant echo rather than a palpable reality, abstractions to be managed rather than battles to be fought.", "subreddit": "SandersForPresident", "created_utc": 1583355705, "author": "seanarturo", "link_id": "t3_fdf2r2", "parent_id": "t1_fjhus5v", "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": true, "disgust": true, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": true, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fhkck1b": {"body": "&gt; # COVID-19: Singapore confirms 9 new cases, 6 linked to Grace Assembly of God church; total at 67\n\n&gt; By Nicholas Yong and Koh Wanting\n\n&gt; SINGAPORE \u2014 A senior Ministry of Health (MOH) official on Friday (14 February) confirmed nine new cases of the novel coronavirus \u2013 the highest in a single day here to date \u2013, bringing the total number of cases here to 67.\n\n&gt; More details of the patients would be shared in a press release later in the evening, said Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, MOH director of medical services, during a press conference led by a multi-ministry taskforce on the virus, also known as COVID-19.\n\n&gt; He shared that six of the new cases are linked to Grace Assembly of God church, one of at least five such identified clusters of local transmissions here.

The last two days saw a steep rise in the number of cases after a change in diagnostic methods in the country.\n\n&gt; The National Health Commission disclosed a statistical error, saying it removed 108 deaths in Hubei that had been double-counted, but the nationwide toll still rose to 1,380 on Friday.\n\n&gt; Three territories,\u00a0Japan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines, have each reported the death of a patient infected with the virus.\n\n&gt; Patients suffering from the new strain may exhibit fever\u00a0and\u00a0symptoms of lower respiratory illness \u2013 such as coughing or difficulty in breathing \u2013 as well as pneumonia-like symptoms like a runny nose, sore throat, and headache.\n\n&gt; However, some who have died from it have not displayed symptoms of fever, according to\u00a0details released by China\u2019s National Health Commission, potentially complicating global efforts to check for infected travellers as they arrive at airports and other travel hubs.\n\n&gt; Stay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore's Telegram channel at\u00a0http://t.me/YahooSingapore\n\n&gt; Related stories:\n\n&gt; Coronavirus: How it's spreading in Singapore and the world\n\n&gt; COVID-19: Singapore announced eight new cases linked to previous patients, total at 58\n\n&gt; COVID-19: Singapore economy to 'take a hit', recession possible due to outbreak - PM Lee\n\n&gt; COVID-19: Healthcare workers get help in seeking refunds for cancelled holiday plans\n\n&gt; COVID-19: $77m package for taxi, private-hire car drivers amid falling ridership\n\n&gt; COVID-19: Six-month-old infant 'doing well', too early to predict peak of virus here, says senior MOH official\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)", "subreddit": "singapore", "created_utc": 1581677840, "author": "sneakpeek_bot", "link_id": "t3_f3qm1o", "parent_id": "t3_f3qm1o", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": true, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fitsb0s": {"body": "&gt; # COVID-19: Panic buying shows 'lack of trust' in government's crisis messaging, says Yaacob Ibrahim\n\n&gt; SINGAPORE \u2014 The \u201cirrational\u201d panic buying of provisions in response to the raising of the country\u2019s outbreak response level shows a \u201clack of trust\u201d in the government telling Singaporeans what is the right thing to do especially during a crisis, said Jalan Besar GRC Member of Parliament Professor Yaacob Ibrahim on Wednesday (26 February).\n\n&gt; \u201cRumours and misinformation about the lack of supplies help to fuel senseless hoarding. It shows a lack of trust; chaos could have broken out leading to unimaginable losses. This is something we all don't want to happen in Singapore,\u201d said the former communications and information minister during his Budget 2020 debate speech in Parliament.\n\n&gt; He noted that the rush to stock up supplies over the weekend following the 7 February announcement that the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorson) level will be raised from yellow to orange due to the COVID-19 outbreak is a reminder that \u201cgetting communications right is very important\u201d.\n\n&gt; \u201cDuring SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003), there was no social media. Today, we are inundated by news of all sorts of various platforms, and from friends and strangers alike,\u201d Prof Yaacob explained.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe fundamental question is whether we trust the government in telling us what is the right thing to do, especially during a crisis.\u201d\n\n&gt; FairPrice\u00a0Group\u00a0CEO Seah Kian Peng spoke in Parliament earlier on the same day about the \u201cshopping frenzy\u201d during the period, saying the cooperative\u2019s measures to limit purchase of some items attracted criticisms from \u201ca minority group\u201d.\n\n&gt; Another issue of trust in the government concerns the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), which some view as an attempt to stifle dissent on the internet, said Prof Yaacob.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere is a sense among them that the government is using this legislation for its own agenda, rather than serving the needs of all people,\u201d he added.\n\n&gt; Last month in Parliament, Minister of Communications and Information\u00a0S Iswaran\u00a0had called it \u201ca coincidence\u201d that the first few cases brought under the law were against political figures and parties.\n\n&gt; Prof Yaacob noted that he is \u201call too familiar\u201d with such concerns, citing his move to license online news sites in 2013 when he was still in the Cabinet.\n\n&gt; Several internet groups had then alleged that the move would kill the diversity of voices on the internet, said Prof Yaacob.\n\n&gt; \u201cAs it turns out, the licensing scheme did not stifle the internet at all. Many groups continue to flourish on the internet,\u201d he added.\n\n&gt; \u201cAll we wanted \u2013 and I'm sure all of us can agree to this \u2013 is responsible behaviour on the internet, especially when the issues affect the lives of so many Singaporeans.\u201d\n\n&gt; Prof Yaacob stressed that the issue of trust \u201cwill continue to arise\u201d as Singapore grapple with increasingly complex issues, such as climate changes and technological advances.\n\n&gt; Dealing with the effects of climate change will \u201craise many questions\u201d about how the government should best use its limited fiscal resources for the good of Singapore, he noted.\n\n&gt; \u201cAnd the government would need to build trust that it is doing what is right for people, even though it means spending significant resources for a very long term period to benefit future generations,\u201d Prof Yaacob added.\n\n&gt; On technology, while Singaporeans trust that the government is using the data captured \u2013 from closed-circuit television cameras\u00a0in void decks and other common areas \u2013 for good, it is not the case in other countries.\n\n&gt; \u201cIn places like San Francisco, the residents have voted against having videos in public places. For our own digitisation efforts to succeed, people must trust that the data is collected solely for the purpose of developing useful services for them,\u201d he said.\n\n&gt; By all accounts, while Singapore has done well in this area thus far, Prof Yaacob pointed out that it is not inconceivable for some people to raise the issues of data privacy.\n\n&gt; The emergence of data protection legislation overseas, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, may also cause some to wonder whether Singapore\u2019s Personal Data Protection Act is sufficiently rigorous.\n\n&gt; \u201cMy intent in raising this issue is that for all of us to be cognisant of the potential hazards awaiting us in our journey towards digitalising of our economy and society,\u201d said Prof Yaacob.\n\n&gt; The questions of trust brought about by the use of technology in everyday lives can range from whether the government can protect Singaporeans from being manipulated by the big tech giants to whether Singaporeans can trust the government to use \u201cpersonal data for the benefit of all Singaporeans and not (for) some political agenda\u201d.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe have seen how trust is broken down in other societies leading to the rise of populism and with social media, and the rise of misinformation and alternative facts, sometimes it is unclear whether the lack of trust in government is an effect of these developments, or is it the cause of the rise of other alternative centres of trust,\u201d he noted.\n\n&gt; Citing Singaporeans\u2019 high trust in public institutions here to do what is right, Prof Yaacob suggested for the Republic to consider creating an independent digital commission to build trust in ensuring new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the use of machine learning algorithms, are used correctly.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe cannot avoid the nagging concerns of privacy and transparency that digitalisation will bring. If we do not deal with this early, then trust in government can be eroded,\u201d he added.\n\n&gt; Related stories:\n\n&gt; COVID-19: FairPrice CEO Seah Kian Peng urges shoppers who have excess stocks to donate to charity\n\n&gt; NTUC to tap 4,000 companies to better match retrenched workers and PMEs to new jobs\n\n&gt; COVID-19: Dorscon level could be lowered if virus spreads worldwide\n\n&gt; COVID-19: 'Please help stop rumours' on Dorscon red \u2013 Health Minister Gan Kim Yong\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)", "subreddit": "singapore", "created_utc": 1582728279, "author": "sneakpeek_bot", "link_id": "t3_f9u8ln", "parent_id": "t3_f9u8ln", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": true, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": true, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": true, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fgnmayt": {"body": " \n\n**As the outbreak of the coronavirus that originated from Wuhan  continues to intensify, some in Singapore have had to comply with  quarantine or leave of absence requirements to do their part in stemming  the spread.

In fact, it is quite cosy to stay home during  winter,\" he told The Straits Times in a phone interview last Friday.\n\nMr Ho, a senior manager in manufacturing, has been holed up in his  apartment with his Chinese wife and their three-year-old son since Jan  23, when the city was put under lockdown, bringing its airport, train  stations and public transport to a standstill.\n\nThe restrictions placed on vehicles and the government's call on  people to stay indoors have made the city look \"like a ghost town\", he  added.\n\nBut that is not unusual during the Chinese New Year period as most  people travel to other parts of China to celebrate, he said, adding that  the supermarkets and pharmacies near his home are well stocked.\n\nLike most of the 140 or so Singaporeans staying put in Wuhan, Mr Ho's spouse is not a Singaporean.\n\nHe met his wife in Wuhan, where he has lived since 2010.\n\nDespite social media posts and news reports often portraying an  alarming picture of the city, he said life is normal. \"Well, except for  the fact that you need to stay indoors and can't leave the city.\"\n\nStill, the family takes precautions even at home, which is about 20km  from Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, named as ground zero of the  epidemic that has spread to more than 20 countries.\n\n  Related Story \n\n#### [Coronavirus: Get latest updates](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/wuhan-virus-follow-our-coverage)\n\n  Related Story \n\n#### [Coronavirus: Singapore confirms 4 new cases, including 6-month-old child of infected couple](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/coronavirus-4-more-confirmed-cases-in-singapore-28-cases-so-far)\n\n  Related Story \n\n#### [askST: When will the coronavirus outbreak ease?](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/askst-when-will-the-coronavirus-outbreak-likely-to-ease)\n\n  Related Story \n\n#### [Interactive: What we know so far about the coronavirus](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/interactive-what-we-know-so-far-about-the-wuhan-virus)\n\nThe family members take their temperature daily, while his wife  washes her hands and disinfects her coat whenever she returns from the  supermarket.\n\nThe only time there was a commotion in the city was when news came of the lockdown, Mr Ho said.\n\n\"There was panic buying as people snatched up most of the food at the  supermarkets. But there wasn't any shoving or shouting,\" he added,  noting that the checkout took over two hours because of the long queues.\n\n\"The next day, the shelves were fully stocked again.\"\n\nThe family had been due to take an early morning flight to Singapore  on Jan 24 to celebrate Chinese New Year, but when they received news in  the wee hours of the morning of Jan 23 that a lockdown would start at  10am, he knew there would be problems.\n\n\"I wasn't exactly shocked at the news because we had heard some  chatter. But this meant we had seven hours to get out of the city.\"\n\nAs foreigners and locals scrambled to pack and leave before the  lockdown, Mr Ho and his family decided it would be better to stay put.\n\n\"There were many uncertainties, like what if we went to another city and were quarantined because we came from Wuhan?\n\n\"Travelling with a toddler is also a challenge. What if we get caught in another city and can't make it back to Singapore?\"\n\nAt the same time, he was confident that Wuhan would not run out of  water or food. \"I felt many resources would be diverted to Wuhan because  of the lockdown - that is why I was assured we would be all right.\"\n\nHe has not left his home in the 14 days since the start of the  lockdown, but work has kept him busy.

I'm a Comic Con vendor and work part time at a bead shop. We've been grinding ever downward since 2016. In 2019 first we had in-person sales tank even worse than the general economy. Next my supplies tripled in price AGAIN. Hong Kong and China fight means I can't get gold plated items so discontinue my most popular item. Then shipping went up. Then listing fees and transaction fees for my online sales went up. Online sales then had sales tax applied automatically instead of being included in my item price (I use VAT and lump sum my quarterly taxes per state). I now have to spend more than double the time filing taxes because my reports per state are now wrong because I pay in person and online on 2 other sites but 1 site decided to submit reports for us! This time takes away from making, photographing, and marketing time, so I post fewer new items for sale. Shows begin to die off as bankruptcies, consolidations, and rescheduling or relocating rocks the industry. Others increased booth fees to make up for lower ticket sales. Due to loss of selling days and acceptable profit margin I'm behind on my business bills and taxes (so goodbye remaining profit as I'm now paying compound interest and late fees). Because I'm late my credit is now bad and I can't get a consolidation loan to reduce the total payments due. Next my online sales and consignment store sales went down massively over 2018 too because of the market contraction. \n\nEnter Covid19. My parts dry up because Chinese manufacturing can't ship anything. My backup sources in other countries (more expensive) take over briefly, but then have to shut down too. As the virus spreads into Seattle my biggest show gets cancelled. Other shows start rescheduling for 2021 as no crowd rules go into effect. All 1st quarter shows are rescheduled for later this year (so I had to cancel some due to schedule conflicts) others are now \"date TBD\". My fees are rolling to the next show when it happens so no cash refund to pay other bills (can't resent this as refund would bankrupt the show producers). Online sales drop off completely as no one is buying cosplay items if they aren't going to a show or filming and performing. My store now cuts hours radically and cancels all classes and Bead Night because of social distancing. \n\n\"Stay at Home Order\" goes through as of today. The store is now closed outright as are all stores where I have pieces consigned. We aren't even allowed to go do inventory to keep workers occupied.This is probably going to put my store out of business permanently because we weren't even making a profit. It's a break even business before this started and the owner has even more debt than I do. She can't even pay to have full time employees. I have no paycheck and no consignment sales. I'm waiting on clarification if I'm allowed to ship goods if anyone orders as it's not \"essential business\" for me to go to the post office. The post office is open and making delivery but for how long will they ship things other than \"essential\" packages? \n\nNormally I can't file for Unemployment because I'm self employed. I'm not disabled enough to get benefits but I'm too disabled to go back to my old career. I'm hoping the rules change because I am totally and utterly fucked otherwise. My husband's job is probably not in danger. He's at home call center tech support for a bank and is now doing not just mandatory overtime but \"voluntary\" part time on weekends too, poor guy. The Philippines and India call centers are closed right now because of quarantine. He says he might as well work every hour he can because there's fuck all else to do. I will not starve or lose my house, unlike a lot of my friends in the industry. \n\nMy husband pays for mortgage, insurance, water &amp; power, internet, car payment, and \"not gonna starve\" food. My income pays for clothes, cell phone, streaming tv and games, gas for the car, \"nice\" groceries, office equipment, cat food, litter, vet, and anything extra like family visiting, presents, or emergency expenses. Except for the cat food and litter we'll survive without my income pretty long in this emergency.\n\nOn a side note, I have been in self quarantine for 21 days now so lost my paycheck from those weeks we were open too. I would have had to cancel Seattle even if he show went on. I had what I thought was flu, but flu does NOT last for 21 days so tomorrow my doc is calling to see if I need to go to the hospital and get tested for pneumonia and possibly Covid19. Pretty sure I don't have Covid19 as the symptoms aren't really a match but they keep updating the symptoms lists now so...

No one was hoarding food, no one was hoarding masks. Sure it was a bit quieter than usual at the big locations like the pyramids and Abu Simbel, but that was a benefit in our eyes.  No one in our group was really worried about egypt and the wifi was poor so we had no clue what was happening in the netherlands.\n\nOur tour guide gave us the \"corona update\" every day, but for the first ten day the update was just \"all is calm, do not worry\".\n\nThen in the middle of the day the guide called our group for a meeting and said \"well we still have ten days to go but our return flight over Austria-Vienna has been cancelled so we can't return like that.

Pack your stuff. We're putting you on an airplane tonight.\"\n\nWe were so confused.

Second, I would like to remind you that not everyone affected by this decision was supportive of it.  There are numerous members of both the faculty and staff who strongly oppose the decisions Jerry Falwell Jr. has made over the past few weeks.  They have been put at risk just as much as the community, or the students.  They are also people who live amongst the community and genuinely care about the students who they have taught and served.  These are people who are often overflowing with love towards others, and this crisis has them battling extreme fear for themselves and their community as well as self-punishment for not being able to make any changes to what's happening.  Everyone needs a paycheck... Unfortunately, Liberty is often ruled by fear and not many have the courage to speak out.  But I ask everyone here to remember these people as well as others who disagree with this course of action rather than lumping everyone together as careless, hateful people.

Quarantine, in general, is an outdated method that rarely works but sounds really good. \n\nObviously you can find ways to make any tactic look bad. That\u2019s not going to go away no matter *what* technique you use. Quarantine? Raise the ire of the people, break their trust in the government, create far greater risk for the people inside the walls than they were in before. Isolation? Potential blowbacks from people with guns, possible damages to families, so on. \n\nThere is no magical cure to the situation. There\u2019s no \u201cone way that\u2019s best\u201d to be had. Quarantines have one result, isolation has another. The question becomes which one has the least consequences. \n\n&gt;\tQuarantining cities is probably significantly easier, cut off all the major exits and most won\u2019t be able to go anywhere. Call a state of emergency and use the military, which most governments of the world are able to do.\n\nThis is where the whole thing falls apart. Unless you\u2019re willing to put up literal walls around the city and station military around the city willing to shoot anyone who tries to escape then you haven no real way of being sure it\u2019s going to work. \n\n\u201cUse the military\u201d to do what, exactly? A strong physical presence isn\u2019t going to deter people who are truly terrified and rebellious. You\u2019re either going to have to kill them, which absolutely breaks trust in the situation, or you need to be able to truly lock it down such that they can\u2019t escape at all. \n\nLet\u2019s not forget that you have to be able to put up the quarantine fast enough that no one can, well, just leave. That pretty much doesn\u2019t happen. Unless you can roll the military in, quietly, while everyone is asleep and suddenly have a lockdown some people are just going to leave through unprotected exits. Those people might be sick and the lock down was, on some level, ineffective. \n\nEven more importantly: \n\nNow that everyone has seen what happened in Wuhan, how many Chinese people do you believe are going to be willing to seek help? There are legitimately people who would rather die free in their homes than risk being locked down.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the reaction to China\u2019s response is incredibly mixed. Some praise it as a Hail Mary that successfully cordoned off a virus. Others point out that there *are* cases outside of the lock down and that those cases may well be spreading quietly without report precisely *because* no one wants to go through Wuhan. \n\nAs to the question of: \n\n&gt;\tEven further, why would anyone volunteer to get tested when they could end up locked away for two weeks?\n\nThis is no less true of a quarantine than it is of isolation. Let\u2019s say that all of Boston locked down. No one in, no one out.

It's speculative for Biden because I think he's just as incompetent, he's also shown his true colors multiple times and his interests  align with big business. I agree with you that Jared Kushner shouldn't be anywhere near the government, but who knows who Joe Biden is going to fill his cabinet out with. He was talking about potentially having key positions for people like Bloomberg. Come on - you really want Bloomberg to have a say over things that have to do with how this country is run? I'm pretty damn sure Bernie wouldn't be bringing in corporate hawks like that to try and establish policy. This entire talking point has gotten a little bit outside of the scope of the original intent - at the end of the day it comes down to Trumps handling of COVID isn't enough to make me vote for Joe Biden. \n\nI think it's a little bit unfair to ask me to develop empathy. I'm very empathetic towards people who are struggling in this country, so much so I was willing to vote for a candidate that would hurt my bottom line financially, as well as institute sweeping social policies to give more opportunities to people who fall outside of the demographic I fit into. His intent in office wouldn't be to improve my life it would be to improve the lives of people less fortunate which I'm all for. What I'm not empathetic towards are moderate liberals with this idea that somehow Biden is going to be the right choice for this country, especially when they try to champion themselves as the people who care about everyone. It's highly likely that some social safety nets will be eaten into and the people who struggle the most won't get the same kind of change they possibly would from a President who would actively push the narrative that how we treat them is not okay. Not one thing will change under Biden versus Trump from my perspective, aside from choosing his words with a little more care, unless of course someone calls him out and he tells them he's going to meet them outside like a god damn lunatic. You may not agree with this at all but it's my POV on the situation and I'm entitled to it in the same way you're entitled to yours. If people in this country don't want sweeping reform to help improve the lives of the less fortunate I'm under no moral obligation to help maintain some weird status quo in politics for moderate liberals to sleep better at night.\n\nSure, it was using an over the top example to explain that the handling of the COVID situation is not changing my mind about Biden. Justifying it by saying he may have handled it in the same way is probably a little extreme, but if you can't tell I really dislike this guy for my own reasons which have 0 to do with him beating Bernie. It'd be hard to fuck it up as badly as Trump but if anyone can do it it's Joe Biden. Honestly the Democrats could've trotted anyone else out from the primary (except Bloomberg) and you would've gotten my vote. I even voted for HC back in 2016 if that means anything to you.

I'm not worried. None of the people I know are worried. The data is promising, and the CDC has everything under control.\n\nIf that's what you're hearing from the government, it's not \"sweeping-shit-under-the-rug nonsense\", it's just the reality. COVID-19 is serious, nobody's saying it's not, but it's not the kind of serious that should result in panic. The medical community deals with serious things every day. Just because something is serious doesn't mean they don't know how, or lack the ability, to handle them.\n\nThe proper response to COVID-19 is cautious preparation and prevention, the exact same preparation and prevention you should be doing anyway for regular flu season. Those of you who normally get a flu vaccine every year (good for you!), you may be extra worried about COVID-19 not having a vaccine yet, and that's understandable. But it's important to remember (and if you didn't know this, now you know) that getting a flu vaccine doesn't mean you can't get the flu. There's always some strains going around that don't make it into the yearly vaccine, and vaccines aren't 100% anyway, so you should always act as if you're not vaccinated, flu shot or not flu shot.\n\nEpidemiology is a pretty complicated thing. While I would like to think that a lot of people could probably understand the situation if explained at a basic enough level, a lot probably still wouldn't, and it doesn't help that our media are scientifically illiterate. They went to journalism school and at their jobs they're told \"if it bleeds, it leads\". That's not conducive to a well-informed public. People are prone to thinking there are conspiracies or cover-ups. In an epidemic, there are actual unknowns, both knowable unknowns and unknown unknowables. The CDC can't give a complete picture because they don't have a complete picture. Giving out information that proves to be wrong in the long run makes people trust them less when it's really important. Not giving out information they simply don't have, only makes people think things are worse than they're being told.\n\nIt's also just a fact that the best informed people on these subjects aren't typically the best communicators.\n\nThe government has lots of reasons to want the public not to panic. The government also has zero reasons to want the public to get sick and die. Those are taxpayers, voters, soldiers and law enforcement, productive citizens of every type. If you are unable to believe that the people managing the crisis have a desire to manage the outbreak as best as they can, I don't know what to tell you, you're probably too far gone off the deep end of crazy town for anything I'm telling you to matter. But if you are able to believe that the people in the CDC, at the hospitals, in the emergency medical services have only the best intentions, then listen to me now.\n\nIt's going to be okay. The best people in the entire world are working on the problem, in and outside of government. These are people who have been managing epidemics big and small their whole careers, many of them for decades. They've seen it all, and they're not panicking. COVID-19 is a new strain, but coronavirus is one of the most studied, best-understood viruses there is. The US medical community has had plenty of warning about this outbreak, have experience with other coronaviruses, and have taken all appropriate steps.\n\nI don't check my reddit inbox all that frequently, but if anyone has any specific concerns they'd like me to address, things that are causing you to panic about COVID-19, I'd be happy to answer any replies to this post asking about things you think people ought to be panicking about. I've had my own concerns along the way, but right now all of them have been resolved to my satisfaction. I'm confident we'll get through this very well.

The factories will still be in China and physical capital takes time to relocate. I imagine the CPC would do everything in their power to try and encourage firms to continue operations in the PRC, with mixed results. Long-term, I expect by the end of this decade that China will see somewhat diminished economic growth as a result of this, if it continues as present.

Regardless of what actual powers the office has, people have a tendency to praise or blame the president for the economy's success or failure, regardless of the actual cause.

No word if it\u2019s potential corona virus, if they\u2019re testing for it or if anyone she was around, like us coworkers need to be taking any precautions. I would have expected the health department or CDC at least would have given us precautionary steps while they are testing them for at least abundance of caution! I\u2019ve seen nothing about it on news, or reported anything else.

I was scary close to being put on a vent -- they wanted to, but there were worse cases in the hospital who needed it more, because it was a bad flu season. I recovered anyway. I have never forgotten the terror of being unable to draw a complete breath, of panting desperately for air, of knowing that the nice nurse sitting 24/7 by my bed was there in case I stopped breathing entirely or had a heart attack. It hurt. I was soooo tired but couldn't sleep. I couldn't eat. All my energy was focused on trying to get enough oxygen in.

Inside China there is a growing sense of helplessness, as the government is compelled to take drastic measures to stop the virus, including introducing some travel restrictions in Beijing. I have received panicked queries from journalists and public health workers in China, asking, \u201cHow can we protect ourselves and our families?\u201d\n\nThe epidemic could have been\u00a0[controlled fairly easily](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/24/opinions/wuhan-coronavirus-china-strategy-garrett/index.html)\u00a0three weeks ago had there been more openness, swift action, and no attempted cover-up. But now it\u2019s too late, and this virus is\u00a0[spreading globally](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/24/wuhan-virus-china-belt-and-road-pandemic/). Because there is no vaccine or treatment for nCoV2019\u2014the Wuhan pneumonia\u2014and infection has spread throughout China, the government is forced to turn to its 2003 SARS playbook. And that means entire cities must be cut off, and the population of the nation must be restricted in its movements and potential disease-spreading behavior. It is not surprising then that travel out of Beijing may be forbidden; the entire mainland could go on lockdown soon.\n\nI know people are very frightened. And I expect panic will rise in the coming days. But very simple measures can protect you.\n\nDuring the SARS epidemic, I traveled all over China and Hong Kong,\u00a0interviewed people infected with the virus, doctors and nurses treating the disease, government officials, police\u2014everybody. I was never concerned that I would become infected, despite being in the room with sick individuals. And that\u2019s because I knew what precautions to take. Here are the most important ones to know:\n\n**1. When you leave your home, wear gloves**\u2014winter mittens or outdoor gloves\u2014and keep them on in subways, buses, and public spaces.\n\n**2. If you are in a social situation where you should remove your gloves,**\u00a0perhaps to shake hands or dine, do not touch your face or eyes, no matter how much something itches. Keep your hands away from contact with your face. And before you put your gloves back on, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water, scrubbing the fingers. Put your gloves on.\n\n**3. Change gloves daily,**\u00a0washing them thoroughly, and avoid wearing damp gloves.\n\n**4. Masks are useless when worn outdoors and may not be very helpful even indoors.**\u00a0Most masks deteriorate after one or two wearings. Using the same mask day after day is worse than useless\u2014it\u2019s disgusting, as the contents of your mouth and nose eventually coat the inside of the mask with a smelly veneer that is attractive to bacteria. I rarely wear a face mask in an epidemic, and I have been in more than 30 outbreaks. Instead, I stay away from crowds, and I keep my distance from individual people\u2014a half meter, about 1.5 feet, is a good standard. If someone is coughing or sneezing, I ask them to put on a mask\u2014to protect me from their potentially contaminated fluids. If they decline, I step a meter (about 3 feet) away from them, or I leave. Don\u2019t shake hands or hug people\u2014politely beg off, saying it\u2019s better for both of you not to come in close contact during an epidemic.\n\n**5. Inside your household, remove all of the towels from your bathrooms and kitchen immediately,**\u00a0and replace them with clean towels that have the names of each family member on them. Instruct everybody in your home to only use their own towels and never touch another family member\u2019s. Wash all towels twice a week. Damp towels provide terrific homes for viruses, like common colds, flus, and, yes, coronaviruses.\n\n**6. Be careful with doorknobs.**\u00a0If it\u2019s possible to open and close doors using your elbows or shoulders, do so. Wear gloves to turn a doorknob\u2014or wash your hands after touching it. If anybody in your home takes sick, wash your doorknobs regularly. Similarly, be cautious with stairway banisters, desktops, cell phones, toys, laptops\u2014any objects that are hand-held. As long as you handle only your own personal objects, you will be ok\u2014but if you need to pick up someone else\u2019s cell phone or cooking tools or use someone else\u2019s computer keyboard, be mindful of not touching your face and wash your hands immediately after touching the object.\n\n**7. If you share meals, do not use your personal chopsticks and utensils**\u00a0to remove food from a serving bowl or plate and, of course, tell your children to never drink out of anybody else\u2019s cups or from a container of shared fluid. It is customary in China to prepare several dishes for a meal and then allow everybody at the table to use their personal chopsticks to pull food from the common dishes: Don\u2019t do this until the epidemic is over. Place serving spoons in each dish and instruct everybody at the table to scoop what they want from the serving dishes onto their personal plates or bowls, return the serving spoon to the main dish, and then use their personal chopsticks only to pick food from their personal plate or bowl into their mouth. Wash all food and kitchenware thoroughly between meals and avoid restaurants that have poor hygiene practices.\n\n**8. Absolutely do not buy, slaughter, or consume any live animal**\u00a0or fish until it is known what species was the source of the virus.\n\n**9. When the weather allows, open your windows**\u00a0at home or work, letting your space air out. The virus cannot linger in a well-ventilated space. But of course, if it is cold or the weather is inclement, keep warm and close those windows.\n\n**10. Finally, if you are caring for a friend or family member who is running a fever,**\u00a0always wear a tight-fitting mask when you are near them, and place one on the ailing person (unless they are nauseated). When you replace an old, dirty mask from the face of your friend or loved one be very, very careful\u2014assume, for the sake of your protection, that it is covered in viruses, and handle it while wearing latex gloves, place it inside of a disposable container, seal it, and then put it in the trash. While wearing those latex gloves, gently wash the patient\u2019s face with warm soap and water, using a disposable paper towel or cotton swab, and seal it after use in a container or plastic bag before placing it in your household trash. Wear long-sleeved shirts and clothing that covers your body when you are caring for your ailing friend or relative. Clean everything your patient wears or touches very thoroughly in hot soapy water, including sheets, towels, and utensils. If you have space, isolate the sick person in your household in a room, or a corner of a room, where they are comfortable, but separated from the rest of the household. If the weather is tolerable, open a window that is on the opposite side of the room, so that air gently blows past the patient\u2019s face and then outdoors. Of course, don\u2019t do this if it is very cold, as your friend or loved one will be made sicker if uncomfortably cold.", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "created_utc": 1581376031, "author": "obiwankenobitoldme", "link_id": "t3_f1vmpo", "parent_id": "t3_f1vmpo", "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "disgust": false, "fear": true, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": false, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fl4ef2l": {"body": "&gt; I\u2019m just gonna skip this because it\u2019s just you agreeing with me.\n\nNo it\u2019s not but fair enough.  \n\n&gt; Ok, herd immunity takes a while \n\nOh so I was not agreeing with you.  Well that\u2019s a surprise.  It can take a good while to be honest.  That\u2019s why we have people working on a vaccine at the moment.  \n\n&gt; but it\u2019s disregarding it entirely is rediculous. \n\nI am disregarding it based on the length of time it takes to kick in and how many people will die before it does.  There is a reason why places like the UK who were talking about this last week are now backing down. \n\n&gt;  The over 70\u2019s are still at risk of a normal flue so they\u2019re always a risk realistically. \n\nThis is not a normal flu. This is nearer a pneumonia which is why it\u2019s so tough to deal with and it is spreading rapidly unlike the flu which is controlled and there are vaccines which a huge number of people would have taken.  The flu jab, the pneumonia shots for example.  \n\n\nWe don\u2019t have ventilators to help a surge in people which means when weighed up between a person likely to survive or a person less likely to survive such as an elderly person or a person in a risk category, they will choose to save the person most likely to survive.  \n\nThe flu is not currently filling up our hospitals and entirely consuming places like China Italy and Spain at a rapid pace.  This is what flattening the curve is all about.  Instead of having 100 people go in on the same day you can take measure to spread those 100 people out over a month or two months.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n &gt; And the majority of people who go to gyms are in the under 70 bracket. \n\nOk this is just dumb.  If you are 30 and you go to the gym.  You pick up covid19 when you are there.  You can now pass it on to the elderly.  That\u2019s why they are asking everyone to stay home and use social distancing.  \n\n\n&gt; You also clearly don\u2019t understand what herd immunity is. \n\nWell I know for a fact it is when enough people build up a resistance to a germ or a virus it naturally stops the spread of the disease. For example the Zika virus in Brazil which took 2 years to see herd immunity really come into effect. We can look at \n\nWe know vaccines can help with things like smallpox and polio and they can help create a herd immunity.  \n\nSo people should become resistant after they are infected thanks to antibodies that can help here.  The problem is they still don\u2019t know if people can become reinfected with this.  The current rate of spreading with this virus is as quickly as the Spanish flu in 1918.  So about 50% of the population at least will need to be infected before we can build up a herd immunity.  \n\nHere is an interesting video to back that all up.  \n\nhttps://externalmediasite.partners.org/Mediasite/Play/45a9a74f18ec45deb338e00ac4cf4e281d?fbclid=IwAR0LH6aEbjwNeW0txxFH2ItnixksVs8y-SkZBXOzf-8L980CwYi3yCf7kUs\n\n\n\n&gt; Don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t be seeing a cent \ud83d\ude09. \n\nThere is also the chance your gym may lose enough money before it reopens that it simply won\u2019t reopen. Is everyone going to keep paying membership if the gym is closed for three months for example? \n\n &gt; And I agree they\u2019re not gonna open at the end of the month. It\u2019ll be two maybe three. \n\nWell I hope they have the money to keep it open for three months and I hope people attend when it does reopen.  \n\n&gt;  But a year?

This is quite different than the law we have now, which is decided by free citizens, who are represented by elected officials who will no longer be in power, since the federal government will now control everything, through its military. \n\nWe\u2019ve already had a tiny taste of this unlawful crap with the \u201cshelter in place\u201d order, which quickly became orders to \u201cstay at home\u201d, which immediately set off yet another unconstitutional occurrence through *actual police checkpoints*, and the random stopping and questioning of citizens going about their lives, which the police are absolutely not allowed to do, and for very good reasons that obviously don\u2019t need to be explained to them. This is because they should already be fully aware of these rights , as they are all American citizens - with exactly the same  rights as everyone else, despite popular belief that they are somehow possessing of \u201cmore\u201d, or even \u201cdifferent\u201d rights than their fellow citizens, which they absolutely are not. \n\nBut with martial law, remember that we\u2019ll be dealing with soldiers - who are technically *government property*, and basically signed their rights away when they enlisted. They took a solemn, legally binding, oath to the United States, and are required to follow the federal government\u2019s orders, and nothing else, under the very real penalty of high treason. Then they voluntarily allowed them selves to be conditioned (aka \u201cbrainwashed\u201d) to do exactly what they\u2019re told *by* that government, and to do it no matter what happens. \n\nThese trained killers are also armed with rifles, tanks, helicopters, aircraft carriers, submarines, missiles, etc. to aid them in carrying out those orders, whatever they may be - and they\u2019ll definitely use them if it somehow becomes \u201cnecessary\u201d. \n\nOf course, wether it\u2019s necessary would be determined by the same government that just stripped us of all our supposedly unalienable rights which once *specifically* protected us from *them*. In other words, we\u2019d be completely fucked... while legally locked in a cage, and probably while being starved and  tortured, as well. It would be the worst thing that could possibly happen to the United States of America, and it\u2019s people. That would mean don\u2019t expect any kind of good to happen, at all, anymore. In other words:\n\nThat\u2019s bad.\n\n\n **-  The Right of the People  to Practice Free Speech**\n\n* This one is simple: You can no longer say anything that the government doesn\u2019t care for, or they can, and surely will, lock you in a cage, indefinitely. That\u2019s with no chance of a trial, which is done to you legally, and for up to  the rest of your life - if that\u2019s what the government wants to do.  \n\nThis new, and massive amount of government power may remind you of the preposterous  \u201cDivine Right of Kings\u201d concept that we spoke of earlier, and it definitely should. That\u2019s not a good thing for us citizens to hear, at all. \n\nThat\u2019s bad. \n\n\n**-  Protection from Unreasonable Searches**\n\n* This is exactly what it sounds like.

This goes all the way up to kicking in your door and taking you to prison, for any reason - no more search warrants, or the requirement of establishing probable cause, to get in the way of \u201cjustice\u201d, which, as I mentioned earlier, are formalities which the government hates \u201cdealing\u201d with. \n\nThis is surely the worst thing imaginable for a citizen of a country that is based on the concept of freedom and liberty for all, since once martial law is declared, all of our unalienable rights, that protect us all, will no longer exist. \n\nHopefully this will help people to understand why the president keeps referring to this so-called \u201csituation\u201d with COVID-19 as a \u201cwar\u201d(which it isn\u2019t) and to himself as a \u201cwartime president\u201d, (which he *definitely* is not) with such frequency. He\u2019s doing this to condition the populace into believing those terrible emergency powers are necessary to grant him, which they most assuredly aren\u2019t. But if there\u2019s one thing any president and his federal government want when so-called \u201csituations\u201d like this arise (where something can be elevated to an unnecessary level of concern so that a panic can then be induced through the media), it\u2019s surely those delicious emergency powers - and apparently, this one wants them at all costs. \n\nThat\u2019s bad. \n\n**In a nutshell:**\n\nThe president keeps saying we\u2019re at war (which isn\u2019t true), so congress can give him way too much power that allows him to use what would be the new, military government, with their own draconian set of laws, to legally do anything to anybody, and all without even the courts, or actual justice, getting in his way. \n\nThat\u2019s bad.

There she sees the consequences of the coronavirus on everyday life.  She warns Dutch people via a message on Facebook: take more measures.\n WRITTEN BY\n Janneke Bosch\n She can well imagine the feeling of many Dutch people: \u201cTwo weeks ago we were where you are now.  I also laughed at first.  You got a mild flu, we thought.  That is not too bad.  But that is really not the case. \u201d\n\n Ambulances drive on and off\n All of Italy is now locked.  Bergamo, where Susanne lives, has a hard time.  \u201cI spoke to a friend who works at the hospital here yesterday.  They can no longer handle the amount of patients.  They have to make choices: who to help and who to let die. \"\n\n That sounds harsh, but that's the situation, says Susanne.  \u201cThere are not enough beds, there is not enough ventilation equipment.  And this virus draws to your lungs, so many patients need respiration.  Ambulances drive on and off all day.  Older people are not even picked up anymore.  It is really an absurd situation. \"\n\n A situation she couldn't have imagined a few weeks ago.  \"It's really unreal.\"  Susanne works at Bergamo airport herself, but is now at home.  \u201cWe are all obliged to take vacation days.  Because there are so many fewer flights now. \u201d  Her husband owns a flower shop.  He prefers to sell as much as possible, so that he can also stay at home afterwards.\n\n Rows for the supermarket\n Many stores are already closed, some are still open.  Susanne herself has \"hoarded\" quite a bit.  \u201cThere are long lines in front of the supermarket.  Someone is only allowed in when someone has come out again. \u201d\n\n Residents of Bergamo have been told that they should stop their social contacts as much as possible.  \u201cWe can't just leave the village anymore.  Then you need a form that states that you need to go to work, for example.  People are also checked whether they have such a form with them. \"  It sounds surreal, but it is necessary, Susanne thinks.  \"It is really a frightening situation.\"\n\n Video lessons\n Her eighteen and fourteen-year-old son and daughter have been at home since last month.  They receive video lessons from school.  Although that does not go smoothly everywhere.  \"They are a bit behind, yes.  But that is not the most important thing now.  My son has to graduate this year.  He wants to study next year at the University of Amsterdam. \"\n\n In the Netherlands we don't have to let it get as far as in Italy, Susanne thinks.  \u201cBut then something has to happen.  I think it is so strange that Rutte does not go further than \"no more shaking hands\".  I thought it was laughable.  Here in Italy all the schools closed after a few days.  And everything just keeps going on with you.  As if you don't realize how serious it is. \u201d\n\n Stay at home\n According to Susanne, the call in Brabant to work mainly at home if possible is a good start.  Yet the hair does not really go far enough.  She tries to convince her family in the Netherlands to stay at home.  \u201cMy mother in Waalwijk wanted to visit a friend in a hospital in Den Bosch.  Don't, I told her. \"\n\n It is not her intention to sow panic, Susanne emphasizes.  \u201cI don't want to scare anyone, but I do want to shake people up.

They could also recommend not to use a helmet as well, then. But let\u00b4s continue reading.\n\n&gt;You should only wear a mask if a healthcare professional recommends it. A facemask should be used by people who have COVID-19 and are showing symptoms.\n\nWhatever, how the fuck you know if you have it but not yet presenting any important symptoms? Anyway, you do that once infected to prevent infecting others one would think. Never mind that, let\u00b4s just continue.\n\n&gt;This is to protect others from the risk of getting infected\n\nOk, as per my assessment above. They say explicitly that it DOES WORK to prevent infecting others while you are infected (or not).\n\nFinally,\n\n&gt;The use of facemasks also is crucial for [health workers](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/infection-control.html) and other [people who are taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 in close settings](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-home-care.html)\u00a0(at home or in a health care facility).\n\nSo it *DOES help to prevent the infection* from an ill person *or propagating it to healthy people* as per the above.

But after the biggest wave of stimulus announcements since the outbreak began, fear is mounting the efforts might not provide the salvation markets are looking for.\n\nEmergency measures in the UK, Italy and Australia, along with a commitment from Germany's Angela Merkel to do \"whatever is necessary,\" were met with fresh waves of selling in stocks, putting the MSCI All-Country World Index on the brink of a bear market. **The gloom veered toward panic after President Donald Trump announced an underwhelming set of US support measures and restricted travel from Europe.**\n\nMore disappointment was to follow, when the European Central Bank left rates unchanged in favour of a temporary expansion of bond purchases. The Stoxx Europe 600 tumbled the most on record while US equities plunged more than 9 per cent, extending losses after a 15-minute NYSE-mandated halt.\n\nWhile government stimulus helped bring an end to the global recession triggered by the financial crisis, investors are increasingly sceptical whether policymakers can forestall a virus-induced downturn. Fiscal and monetary measures may only help with the knock-on effects of the epidemic's widespread shutdown of economic activity, leaving investors little option but to await the subsiding of the virus itself.\n\n\"The central bank 'put' has established a floor under risk assets for the past decade. This is the first time that markets are seriously questioning whether it will work again,\" Jason Daw, a strategist at Societe Generale SA in Singapore, wrote in a note on Thursday.\n\n\"While fiscal policy is better medicine than monetary, neither are properly equipped to mitigate the coronavirus-induced growth shock.\"\n\n**Error-laden announcements added to Thursday's tumult. Trump's initial comments suggested restrictions on both travel and trade from Europe, while subsequent clarifications emphasised it applied just to people. Even then, the news underscores how steps to slow the spread of the disease unavoidably also hammer businesses, and so corporate earnings and sharemarket valuations.**\n\nTrump spoke little more than an hour after his Australian counterpart, whose own announcements similarly failed to assuage equity investors. Prime Minister Scott Morrison formally announced nearly $18 billion in stimulus. The S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index, which had opened in the red, saw losses more than double at one point before closing 7.4 per cent lower. It is set for similar losses on Friday.\n\nThe ECB, for its part, left its deposit facility rate and its main refinancing rate unchanged, while it added $US135 billion ($213 billion) of net asset purchases through the end of 2020. Shares of banks nevertheless extended their drop to 12 per cent.\n\nStocks extended losses as ECB President Christine Lagarde put the ball in the court of European governments. She urged a coordinated fiscal response and said the virus's implication for inflation is highly uncertain.\n\nYet the German chancellor's pledge to pull out all stops to contain the economic damage from the virus failed to impress markets. Merkel and her economic team are ready to give up a balanced budget to pay for containment measures, according to people with direct knowledge of the government's economic policy.\n\nThe UK's coordination of fiscal and monetary initiatives didn't do much to stem the slide in the nation's stocks either. The Bank of England cut interest rates by half a point on Wednesday, when the UK government also pledged a $US39 billion emergency boost to spending.\n\nOne market where authorities are proving purposefully unhelpful is oil. With Saudi Arabia and Russia battling for market share, that's provided a double whammy, alongside the hit due to sliding demand as global growth decelerates.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude has tumbled by roughly half from the high in January.\n\nTrump's actions might not have prevented a bear market for US stocks, but in another market things have moved in a more favourable direction. The dollar, which Trump has long said was strong and hurting US competitiveness, is on the retreat - at least against the euro and yen. Losses for emerging-market currencies make the dollar index a more equivocal play.\n\nThe asset that for the moment stands out as potentially less responsive to fear and panic is gold.

The Western World's response/perception is secondary by a large margin. Our opinions of China poses no real threat to the CCP cause they know they have the world eating from their hands economically. \n\nSo, what is up with all these escalating actions? Well, look internally. People are most unhappy and ready to put blame on the government when they can't put food on the table. The **Wuhan Virus** is preventing people from putting food on the table, and everyone's grandparents/parents are at risk of dying. Furthermore, China's economy was already slowing prior to this cluster-fuck. By shutting down cities, China is going to see a further decline into recession with every passing day. What happens then? People lose business, lose livelihood, lose their quality of life, and all the prosperity that they've enjoyed for the past ~20 years or so. Who do they blame then? The West? Or the CCP for mismanaging the initial outbreak?\n\n* Here comes CCP with the elbow from the top rope! Military exercises in Taiwan! *\"LOOK HOW BIG OUR BALLS ARE!

The CCP doesn't give a fuck what you think. This is propaganda with a primary aim of quelling doubts and redirecting frustration of their own people. The CCP, at least XJP's version of it, is a half-played Jenga Tower right now. They're desperately trying to find the next block that's safe to remove. The likely outcome is XJP's reign will be toppled by internal rivals. Then the Jenga Tower will be rebuilt. Then we'll copy-pasta this post again in ~20 - 30 years time.\n\nGood luck and stay healthy, y'all!", "subreddit": "worldnews", "created_utc": 1584652327, "author": "Truesday", "link_id": "t3_fl5asj", "parent_id": "t3_fl5asj", "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": false, "disgust": true, "fear": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "optimism": false, "pessimism": true, "sadness": false, "surprise": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false}, "complete": false}, "fkzcy03": {"body": "December 31: China reports the discovery of the coronavirus to the World Health Organization.\n\nJanuary 6: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a travel notice for Wuhan, China due to the spreading coronavirus.\n\nJanuary 7: The CDC established a coronavirus incident management system to better share and respond to information about the virus.\n\nJanuary 11: The CDC issued a Level I travel health notice for Wuhan, China.\n\nJanuary 17: The CDC began implementing public health entry screening at the 3 U.S. airports that received the most travelers from Wuhan \u2013 San Francisco, New York JFK, and Los Angeles.\n\nJanuary 20: Dr. Fauci announces the National Institutes of Health is already working on the development of a vaccine for the coronavirus.\n\nJanuary 21: The CDC activated its emergency operations center to provide ongoing support to the coronavirus response.\n\nJanuary 23: The CDC sought a \u201cspecial emergency authorization\u201d from the FDA to allow states to use its newly developed coronavirus test.\n\nJanuary 27: The CDC issued a level III travel health notice urging Americans to avoid all nonessential travel to China due to the coronavirus.\n\nJanuary 29: The White House announced the formation of the Coronavirus Task Force to help monitor and contain the spread of the virus and provide updates to the President. \n\nJanuary 31: The Trump Administration:\n\n    Declared the coronavirus a public health emergency.\n     \n    Announced Chinese travel restrictions.\n     \n    Suspended entry into the United States for foreign nationals who pose a risk of transmitting the coronavirus.\n\nJanuary 31: The Department of Homeland Security took critical steps to funnel all flights from China into just 7 domestic U.S. airports.\n\nFebruary 3: The CDC had a team ready to travel to China to obtain critical information on the novel coronavirus, but were in the U.S. awaiting permission to enter by the Chinese government.\n\nFebruary 4: President Trump vowed in his State of the Union Address to \u201ctake all necessary steps\u201d to protect Americans from the coronavirus.\n\nFebruary 6: The CDC began shipping CDC-Developed test kits for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus to U.S. and international labs.\n\nFebruary 9: The White House Coronavirus Task Force briefed governors from across the nation at the National Governors\u2019 Association Meeting in Washington.\n\nFebruary 11: The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) expanded a partnership with Janssen Research &amp;

Sample\nThis report describes the characteristics of 1016 patients who died and were COVID-19 positive in Italy. \n(Table : Distribution of case deaths in regions)\n2. Demographic data\nThe average age of deceased patients positive for COVID-19 is 79.4 years (median 80.0, range 38-100, Range\nInterQuartile - IQR 75.0-85.8). There are 289 women (28.4%). Figure 1 shows that the median age of the patients\nCOVID-19 positive deceased is about 15 years higher than that of patients who have contracted\ninfection (median age: patients deceased 80 years - patients with infection 65 years). Figure 2 shows the\nnumber of deaths by age group. Women who died after becoming infected with COVID-19 have\na higher age than men (median age: women 84 - men 79). Figure 3 shows lethality\n(deaths/sicknesses) by age group. As the figure shows, lethality increases markedly after 70\nyears.\n(Figure 1. Median age deceased and diagnosed positive for COVID-19)\n(Figure 2. Number of deaths by age group)\n(Figure 3. Lethality by age group)\n3. Pre-existing pathologies\nTable 1 presents the most common pre-existing chronic pathologies (diagnosed before contracting\ninfection) in deceased patients. This figure was obtained in 268/1016 deceased (26.4% of the sample\ntotal). The average number of pathologies observed in this population is 2.7 (median 2, Deviation\nStandard 1.5). Altogether, 3 patients (1.1% of the sample) had 0 pathologies, 7 0 (26.1%)\nhad 1 pathology, 69 had 2 pathologies (25.7%) and 126 (47.0%) had 3 or more pathologies.\n\n4. Symptoms\nFigure 4 shows the symptoms most commonly observed before admission in deceased patients\nCOVID-19 positive. As shown in the figure, dyspnea and fever are the symptoms of more\ncommon finding, less common are coughing, hemoptysis and diarrhea.\nFigure 4. Most common symptoms found in COVID-19 positive deceased patients\n\n5. Complications\nRespiratory failure was the most commonly observed complication in this sample\n(98.8% of cases), followed by shock (22.9%), acute renal damage (16.9%) and overinfection (10.8%).\n6. Deaths under 40 years of age\nTo date (March 13) there are 2 COVID-19 positive deceased patients under 40 years of age.
